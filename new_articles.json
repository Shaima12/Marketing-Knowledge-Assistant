    "content": "The debate about AEO/GEO centers on whether it’s a subset of SEO, a standalone discipline, or just standard SEO. Deciding on where to plant a flag is difficult because every argument makes a solid case. There’s no doubt that change is underway and it may be time find where all the competing ideas intersect and work from there.\nMany SEOs argue that AEO/GEO doesn’t differentiate itself enough to justify being anything other than a subset of SEO, sharing computers in the same office.\nHarpreet Singh Chatha ( X profile ) of Harps Digital recently tweeted about AEO / GEO myths to leave behind in 2025.\nThe legendary Greg Boser ( LinkedIn profile ), one of the original SEOs since 1996 tweeted this :\n“At the end of the day, the core foundation of what we do always has been and always will be about understanding how humans use technology to gain knowledge.\nWe don’t need to come up with a bunch of new acronyms to continue to do what we do. All that needs to happen is we all agree to change the “E” in SEO from “Engine” to “Experience”.\nThen everyone can stop wasting time writing all the ridiculous SEO/GEO/AEO posts, and get back to work.”\nWhat contributes to the perception that AEO/GEO is not a real thing is that many proponents of AEO/GEO fail to differentiate it from standard SEO. We’ve all seen it where someone tweets their new tactic and the SEO peanut gallery chimes in, nah, that’s SEO.\nBack in October Microsoft published a blog post about optimizing content for for AI where they asserted:\n“While there’s no secret strategy for being selected by AI systems, success starts with content that is fresh, authoritative, structured, and semantically clear.”\nThe post goes on to affirm the importance of SEO fundamentals such as “Crawlability, metadata, internal linking, and backlinks” but then states that these are just starting points. Microsoft points out that AI search provides answers, not ranked list of pages. That’s correct and it changes a lot.\nMicrosoft says that now it’s about which pieces of content are being ranked:\n“In AI search, ranking still happens, but it’s less about ordering entire pages and more about which pieces of content earn a place in the final answer.”\nThat kind of echoes what Jesse Dwyer of Perplexity AI recently said about AI Search and SEO :\n“As for the index technology, the biggest difference in AI search right now comes down to whole-document vs. “sub-document” processing.\n…The AI-first approach is known as “sub-document processing.” Instead of indexing whole pages, the engine indexes specific, granular snippets (not to be confused with what SEO’s know as “featured snippets”).”\nMicrosoft recently published an explainer called “ From discovery to influence:A guide to AEO and GEO ” that’s tellingly focused mostly on shopping, which is notable and remarkable because there’s a growing awareness that ecommerce stands to gain a lot from AI Search.\nNo such luck for informational sites because it’s also gradually becoming understood that Agentic AI is poised to strip informational sites of all branding and value-add and treating them as sources of data.\nSome of what some champion as GEO and AEO are actually longstanding SEO practices:\nSome of in the GEO Is Real campe tend to regard themselves as evolving with the times but they also acknowledge they’re just offering what the clients are demanding. SEO practioners are in a hard spot, what are you going to do? Plant your flag on traditional SEO and turn your back on what potential clients are begging for?\nThere are Googlers such as Robby Stein (VP of Product), Danny Sullivan, and John Mueller who say that SEO is 100% still relevant because under the hood AI is just firing off Google searches for top ranked sites to backfill into synthesized answers and links ( Read: Google Downplays GEO – But Let’s Talk About Garbage AI SERPs ). OpenAI was recently hiring a content strategist that is able to lean into to SEO (not GEO), which some say demonstrates that even OpenAI is focused on traditional SEO.\nManick Bhan ( LinkedIn profile ), founder of the Search Atlas SEO suite, offered an interesting take on why we may be transitioning to a divided SEO and GEO path.\n“SEO has always meant ‘search engine optimization,’ but in practice it has historically meant ‘Google optimization.’ Google defined the interface, the ranking paradigm, the incentives, and the entire mental model the industry used.\nThe challenge with calling GEO a ‘sub-discipline’ of SEO is that the LLM ecosystem is not one ecosystem, and Google’s AI Mode is becoming a generative surface itself.”\nManick asserts that there is no one “GEO” because each of the AI search and answer engines use different methodologies. He observed that the underlying tactics remain the same but the “the interface, the retrieval model, and the answer surface” are all radically changed from anything that’s come before.\nManick believes that GEO is not SEO, offering the following insights:\n“My position is clear: GEO is not just SEO with a fresh coat of paint, and reducing it to that misses the fundamental shift in how modern answer engines actually retrieve, rank, and assemble information.\nYes, the tactics still live in the same universe of on-page and off-page signals. Those fundamentals haven’t changed. But the machines we’re optimizing for have.\nEven seemingly small mechanics — like logit calibration and temperature — produce practically different retrieval outputs, which is why identical prompts across engines show measurable semantic drift and citation divergence.\nThis is why we’re seeing quantifiable, repeatable differences in:\nIn this landscape, humility and experimentation matter more than dogma. Treating all of this as ‘just SEO’ ignores how different these systems already are, and how quickly they’re evolving.”\nMaybe one of the reasons for the anti-GEO backlash is that there is a loud contingent of agencies and individuals who have very little experience with SEO, some who are fresh out of college with zero experience. And it’s not their lack of experience that gets some SEOs in ranting mode. It’s the things they purport are GEO/AEO that are clearly just SEO.\nYet, as Manick of Search Atlas pointed out, AI search and chat surfaces are wildly different from classic search and it’s kind of closing ones eyes to the obvious to deny that things are different and in transition."

    "content": "In every digital transformation I’ve consulted on, from global banks to manufacturing giants, the failure point isn’t usually the strategy. It’s the governance.\nStrategy defines where to go. Operations define how to get there. Governance is what keeps everyone moving in the same direction, at the same speed, without crashing into each other.\nIn my earlier Search Engine Journal articles, we built the foundation for this discussion:\nThis article closes the loop. Because until governance and accountability take hold, every strategy, no matter how visionary, remains a PowerPoint slide.\nGovernance has a branding problem. Too often, it’s mistaken for red tape – a set of rules designed to slow things down. In reality, good governance is what lets organizations move faster without flying apart. It’s a system of guardrails , not gates – a shared framework that protects creativity by keeping it aligned with purpose.\nWhen done right, governance is the difference between freedom and anarchy. It ensures that every team, design, dev, content, and analytics can innovate confidently within an agreed-upon structure of trust, compliance, and clarity.\nGovernance doesn’t limit autonomy; it enables responsible autonomy.\nThe most effective Centers of Excellence build their governance around three principles:\nThis turns governance into a living framework – one that scales excellence, accelerates innovation, and protects enterprise value simultaneously.\nA true Center of Excellence (COE) isn’t a department—it’s an alignment mechanism.\nIts power lies in uniting diverse roles around shared definitions of value, performance, and accountability.\nAn effective COE sits at the crossroads of these groups. It translates corporate objectives into digital guardrails, workflows, and shared KPIs.\nAnd it does so through clarity of ownership – who decides, who executes, and who is accountable for outcomes.\nWithout that alignment, teams drift into the ownership gap I outlined in “ Who Owns Web Performance? ,” each optimizing their own slice while the organization loses system-level performance.\nA COE that works isn’t a poster on the wall but an ecosystem built around five components:\nA COE that enforces and evolves them is a growth engine.\nEffective governance transforms from control to enablement when standards become self-reinforcing. Instead of asking, “Did we follow the rules?” teams ask, “Do the rules help us move faster and smarter?” That’s the culture shift a Center of Excellence exists to create.\nIn “ Epiphany 2 — Leverage Corporate Judo ,” I wrote that the secret to lasting change isn’t fighting the system – it’s using its momentum. You don’t overpower corporate structure; you redirect it.\n“The art of corporate judo is learning to use the organization’s own weight to create forward motion.”\nWeb governance works the same way. Rather than viewing process and policy as obstacles, a skilled COE converts them into leverage – turning approvals, reporting lines, and compliance requirements into tools for acceleration. A well-designed COE doesn’t rebel against structure; it channels it toward growth.\nIn this sense, governance becomes corporate aikido by absorbing friction and transforming it into alignment.\nBefore you can optimize, you must align. The most advanced analytics stack or SEO roadmap will fail if the organization itself is out of sync.\nA functioning COE creates connective tissue between:\nIn multinational environments, this alignment prevents the “ geo-targeting misalignment ” I’ve written about – where the wrong market page ranks, or translation replaces true localization. The COE becomes the referee between global efficiency and local relevance.\nAI has raised the stakes for governance. In the old world, poor governance hurt rankings. In the new world, it hurts eligibility.\nSearch-grounded AI systems like Google’s AI Overviews and Bing Copilot rely on structured, accessible, and authoritative data to decide what’s trustworthy enough to include. If your schema, content, or infrastructure is inconsistent, the machine can’t reconcile your brand—and when it can’t reconcile, it omits you.\nIf SEO was about visibility, AI is about eligibility – and eligibility depends on governance.\nAs I argued in “ Stop Retrofitting. Start Commissioning: The New Role of SEO in the Age of AI ,” The role of SEO and, by extension, digital governance has shifted from a reactive fix to a proactive design function. SEO is no longer the cleanup crew that patches gaps after launch. It must become the Commissioning Authority, the group that ensures what’s being built meets both user and machine standards before it ever goes live.\nGovernance, in this new context, isn’t back-office oversight. It’s front-office enablement.\nIt ensures that every digital asset – content, structure, schema, and technical architecture – is commissioned for machine interpretation, not just human readability.\nBecause in today’s AI-first ecosystem, the question isn’t simply, “Can users find us?” It’s “Can machines trust, understand, and use us?”\n“The era of being brought in after launch is over. Governance – and SEO – must move upstream to where strategy and systems are conceived.”\nGood governance isn’t a final check; it’s a design ethos. It transforms your organization from retrofitting performance to commissioning excellence.\nAnd that shift from reactivity to readiness is what separates the brands that survive AI disruption from the ones that silently vanish from the conversation.\nGovernance may not sound glamorous, but it’s the lever that compounds returns across every other investment.\nIn financial terms, governance converts digital activity into operating leverage by increasing output without proportionally growing cost. This means your overall Web Effectiveness is a shareholder issue, not a marketing one. Governance is how you turn that theory into muscle.\nUltimately, governance fails when it’s delegated. A COE can’t succeed without executive willpower and cross-functional buy-in.\nThe CEO owns shareholder value. The CMO owns demand. The CTO owns systems. But the COE owns the connection between them.\nIf your website is the factory, your COE is the operations manual that keeps it producing value – efficiently, predictably, and at scale.\nWeb governance isn’t a brake pedal; it’s a steering system. It creates the clarity and confidence that allow innovation to scale safely. It’s how large organizations protect creativity without chaos — and how they turn complexity into compound value.\nIn the age of AI, alignment isn’t optional. Governance is growth."
