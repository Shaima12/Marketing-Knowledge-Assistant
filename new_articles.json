But it’s quickly becoming one of the best.\nThis is because, while the NHS workforce keeps growing, staffing gaps persist. The Long-Term Workforce Plan aims to expand medical school places to 10,000 by 2028/29, but this effort won’t solve the current shortages. And traditional recruitment methods clearly aren’t filling these roles.\nThat’s where social media comes in, offering a faster, more direct route to candidates. Here’s how you can put it to work.\nNearly one in three NHS staff say they feel burnt out because of their work. What’s more, from 2023 to 2024, 10.1% of hospital and community healthcare workers left the NHS . While this is one of the lowest rates in a decade, it’s still a sign of persistent churn.\nThe result is a workforce that’s slowly increasing, yet continues to face critical gaps and rising pressure on recruitment teams.\nSeveral challenges around healthcare recruitment in 2025 make it hard to net and retain talent:\nTraditional recruitment methods often fall short in the face of these demands. They don’t make it easy for candidates to connect quickly or get a full picture of an organisation. They’re also expensive to use.\nHere’s how social media recruitment changes the equation by helping healthcare providers overcome these challenges:\nIn the UK, 79% of job seekers used social platforms in the past year to support their search, while 91% of employers now include social media in their hiring processes. In fact, the same report also shows that the average company now spends a quarter of its recruitment budget on social.\nAnd this trend is important in the healthcare industry as 67% of job seekers look for health and wellness roles via social platforms, the survey states. In this respect, the message is clear: If you’re hiring for healthcare, you need to be on social.\nRecruitment content must balance authenticity with strict compliance, or you face fines and legal backlash.\nImagine that you’re sharing a nurse’s story for a recruiting drive. Here’s how to strip out the public health information and share that story safely:\nIf you’re unsure about compliance, check out gov.uk data protection guidance and Sprout’s governance guide for best practices.\nMeasuring recruitment activity helps prove value and refine social media campaigns. To track recruitment properly, focus on these three main metrics:\nSee this in Sprout’s Premium Analytics dashboard for a real-time view of performance. And always remember to add UTM tags to links so you can attribute results to specific posts or campaigns.\nA multi-platform approach reaches both established clinicians and early-career applicants.\nLinkedIn stands out as the strongest platform for healthcare recruitment because it focuses on career development and professional growth. Candidates expect to see job postings, career stories and leadership content.\nThese LinkedIn best practices will enable you to target healthcare professionals you’re hoping to recruit:\nTo manage everything in one place, route all candidate replies into Sprout’s Smart Inbox , where you can tag, assign and track conversations. This step prevents job enquiries from slipping through the cracks.\nFacebook groups act as hubs where professionals share experiences, swap advice and look for new opportunities. Building a presence here enables you to connect directly with candidates who may not be active on LinkedIn.\nHere’s how you can improve your healthcare marketing in Facebook groups or on your Facebook page:\nYou can also run lookalike ad campaigns for vacancies on Facebook. To do this, look for patterns in the engagement demographics and run ads that target similar demographics and backgrounds.\nAnd always remember to check how users feel about your posts to make sure you’re representing yourself in the right light. You can use Sprout Listening to analyse group sentiment to understand whether your contributions resonate with the right candidates.\nInstagram and TikTok are where younger recruits and students spend their time. That makes these social networks essential for building awareness among the next generation of healthcare professionals.\nShort-form, authentic video content is the best way to cut through. Here are some of the key formats to try:\nRemember to keep it real as these platforms thrive on authenticity. To encourage candidates to engage better, you need to make them feel your content reflects genuine experiences.\nOnce you’ve created those day-in-the-life clips or Q&A reels, store and tag them in Sprout’s Asset Library. That way, you protect brand consistency and make it easy to repurpose the most engaging content across future campaigns.\nYou can’t create content that speaks to healthcare workers unless you understand what they struggle with.\nThis is where social listening tools give you an advantage. Use social listening to track conversations about burnout, training, pay and work-life balance. These tools help you surface candidate pain points, preferences and online behaviours in real time.\nWith these insights, you can turn raw data into actionable strategies that improve how you attract and engage healthcare candidates:\nWhen candidates see you engaging with their reality, they’re more likely to trust your employer brand.\nRecruitment content in healthcare has to walk a fine line. It needs to be engaging enough to attract candidates but also compliant with NHS, GDPR and accessibility rules.\nTry creating a checklist to help you stay consistent while giving candidates a transparent, trustworthy experience:\nWhen you follow a repeatable checklist like this, every post reinforces your employer brand, protects compliance and enhances the candidate experience.\nStaff stories are among the most powerful recruitment tools because they show real people in real roles. But to stay compliant, you must protect patient privacy and follow GDPR.\nHere’s a quick look at what to include and what to omit, so your staff stories stay compelling without exposing protected health information:\nBy anonymising sensitive details while still drawing on real experiences, you keep your content human and authentic but avoid compliance issues.\nUnder The Equality Act, accessible recruitment content is a legal requirement. On top of this, gov.uk accessibility standards set out the practical steps for accessibility (like alt text, captions and colour contrast) that are mandatory for the public sector.\nBut this isn’t just about staying out of legal trouble. Accessible, inclusive design attracts a wider, more diverse pool of candidates, which directly strengthens your workforce.\nAnd with a strong balance of compliance, accessibility and authenticity, candidates will see your health services organisation as both trustworthy and inclusive.\nBuilding a toolkit keeps you organised and ensures your posts land when candidates are actually listening.\nBuild a 3-month rolling plan that blends clinical calendars with recruitment campaigns:\nCandidates expect quick, clear replies. And in a sector where trust matters, leaving messages unread can cost you applicants.\nTo keep filling roles in a competitive market, you need to measure what works , refine your tactics and repeat.\nStart by building a custom recruitment dashboard in Sprout where you bring together hire, application and engagement metrics for a single live view of performance. Pinpoint what works and duplicate this.\nNext, use A/B testing to sharpen creative and targeting. Test headlines against images, long vs. short videos or different CTA phrasing. These small tweaks can reveal what truly motivates candidates to click, apply or share.\nTo get into a rhythm of testing, set monthly experiments in Sprout’s Experiments tool. That way, you’re constantly learning and adapting your content strategy rather than relying on hunches.\nSprout tip: Switch on Sprout notifications so you’re alerted the moment a winning variant emerges.\nHiring in healthcare is tough, but the right social strategy makes your organisation feel human and trustworthy.\nWith Sprout Social, you can listen, connect and measure what works, so that every campaign feels real to candidates and delivers results for your teams.
