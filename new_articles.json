With Gen Z and other high-intent users turning to Pinterest to shop, optimizing your profile for both in-platform and external search makes it a powerful part of your social media search strategy .\nBelow, you’ll learn the essential steps to use Pinterest SEO to capture intent, build authority and connect with your target audience where they’re actively engaged.\nPinterest SEO is the practice of optimizing your Pinterest profile, Pins and boards for search discoverability. The network has become its own search engine as Pinners search for ideas, products and inspiration. But it also feeds search engines like Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo. Today, LLMs, AI snippets and other emerging tools are starting to surface Pinterest content. As these capabilities evolve, brands have a significant opportunity to use Pinterest to strengthen visibility across both social and AI-powered search.\nBy investing in Pinterest SEO, each Pin, interaction and a bit of traction you gain helps reinforce your E-E-A-T signals (experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness) across search algorithms.\nUnlike many traditional search engines, Pinterest offers a visual-first experience. Users aren’t just searching for terms to find information. They also use Pinterest as part of their creative process, looking for inspiration, tutorials and products that meet their needs.\nHere’s a Pin from Jones + CO Modern Mercantile, which features its face serum in an attractive display that appeals to its audience’s aesthetic preferences:\nThe visual search experience reflects a shift in user behavior, especially among younger generations. Consider these Pinterest statistics about Gen Z habits:\nThese Pinterest trends reveal the opportunity your brand has to connect with audiences where they like to browse, plan and shop, while also supporting your broader SEO efforts.\nAs of 2025, 578 million active users visit Pinterest each month. According to the 2025 Sprout Social Index™ , 42% of consumers have a profile on Pinterest. This buyer-focused community makes Pinterest a powerful tool for content marketing, e-commerce and search-intent strategies.\nHere are some key reasons Pinterest works so well as part of a strong SEO strategy:\nWhile Pinterest supports SEO across engines, it’s become a powerful network for internal search. Users often begin the buyer’s journey here as they look for ideas and products. Posting Pins through this top-of-the-funnel search channel helps you inspire your audience and guide them to action via CTAs within your posts.\nThankfully, with Pinterest marketing , you don’t have to guess what users are searching for. Pinterest data provides insights into search terms for keyword research , allowing you to create and optimize content aligned with user interests. Here’s a peek at some of the top trends and Pinterest keywords in the US:\nIt’s not just SEO professionals who know search has changed. Your non-techy relative might use ChatGPT to find a recipe, and your best friend may rely on Google’s AI snippets to identify cold symptoms. As the traditional Google-first search funnel starts to fade, standard search engine optimization is evolving into search everywhere optimization . And Pinterest plays a central role in that shift.\nAccording to SEO expert and uSERP co-founder Jeremy Moser, “Pinterest is unique because it structures visual content around intent-rich queries, essentially acting like a search engine built for discovery. From an AI perspective, that makes it incredibly valuable. When ChatGPT and other LLMs generate answers, Pinterest often appears as a source because boards and Pins are organized semantically: They combine keyword-optimized titles, descriptions and image context in a way that’s machine-readable. That means well-optimized Pins can influence not just Pinterest search visibility but also how AI systems interpret and return results on visual trends, lifestyle queries and even product discovery prompts.”\nAs Moser points out, Pinterest’s high-intent searches and crawlability make it a great opportunity for your social search strategy. Pinterest also offers analytics so you can track and measure results to prove ROI.\nHere’s an example showing a user asking for kitchen backsplash ideas, and the AI returning a Pin as a source. That visibility could benefit a brand selling backsplashes or a local installation company looking to drive leads.\nSeveral factors influence how your Pinterest content ranks. Here are a few Pinterest SEO tips to help strengthen your strategy:\nThe more that users engage with your posts, the more you’ll support E-E-A-T and build authority. Nat Miletic, founder of Clio Websites , a Calgary web design and SEO agency, explains the connection. “Publishing meaningful content […] on Pinterest strengthens expertise by demonstrating knowledge, supports authoritativeness by growing a visible following and builds trustworthiness. […] Platforms like Pinterest, LLMs and search engines can more easily connect the dots about your brand, which supports stronger rankings and visibility.”\nAnalyzing the “dots” that Miletic references starts with tracking engagement signals like saves (formerly Repins), clicks and comments. These indicators tell crawlers your content meets search intent.\nPro tip: Optimize each Pin with a keyword-rich title and use relevant terms in the Pin description.\nHere’s a Video Pin from SDCTS, an apparel brand, featuring high-waist pants. It’s a good example of how to gauge engagement, boost authority and refine your digital marketing strategy for Pinterest SEO. It received 25 crawlable comments about the product, and users saving it signals value and increases reach.\nWhen building your profile, be sure to include relevant keywords that can appear in Pinterest search results and across other search engines.\nAnother way to optimize your profile is by creating boards. Pinterest boards are curated pages where you can collect and organize Pins. Think of them like library stacks with different areas devoted to a certain focus or genre. For example, a pet food brand might have boards like “Organic dog foods” and “Top dog treats.” If a board gets too large, you can create sections for micro-categories such as “dog treats for sensitive stomachs” and “dog treats for large dogs.”\nEach board is an indexable page that provides opportunities to add keyword-rich titles and descriptions that improve search performance. Creating highly targeted boards increases your chances of showing up in results for specific needs.\nThe right keywords aren’t just effective for boards. They also help keep your Pins discoverable long after publishing. Since Pinterest content is evergreen, Pins continue to surface in search as users engage with and collect them over time. To increase your visibility and long-term reach, remember to use keywords in your titles, descriptions and alt text.\nOptimize for performance by refreshing your titles and descriptions quarterly using trending insights from\n. While this capability doesn’t pull trending chatter from Pinterest in particular, it does provide relevant keywords and topics across your other networks to inspire discovery for Pinterest keywords.\nTo grow your impact through Pinterest, include these key Pinterest SEO best practices in your marketing strategy:\nYour Pinterest profile should clearly communicate who you are, what you offer and whom you serve. For example, a bio description for a casual apparel brand might read:\n“Comfortable apparel for active men who love nature. Get breathable shirts and flexible shorts for jogging, hiking and everyday outdoor activities.”\nThis brief description incorporates SEO keywords and signals while addressing these interests and needs:\nYour bio is just one opportunity to enrich your SEO. You can also optimize board titles and descriptions by focusing on the subcategory you want to feature and weaving in keywords that reinforce your brand positioning and topic authority.\nSprout tip: Open or convert to a Pinterest Business Account to access full Pinterest analytics capabilities and custom Pin formats, such as Rich Pins.\nSince Pinterest is a visual search engine with a creative user base, you’ll want to publish appealing and engaging Pin designs. Pinterest offers a variety of formats for creating interactive, design-forward content, such as:\nEach Pin should have fresh, modern visuals. If you use text, make sure the Pin title is clear, concise and doesn’t overwhelm the graphic. Prioritize value and give users a reason to engage.\nMost importantly, make your Pins relevant to your audience. According to Sprout’s 2025 Content Benchmark Report , consumers prefer relatable, authentic and entertaining content, underscoring that quality matters more than volume.\nEach Pin you publish should inform your SEO strategy. But tracking your progress, comparing it across organic and paid efforts and reporting business outcomes to stakeholders can be a challenge.\nWith Sprout’s Pinterest integration , you can tag posts to measure and report on your performance. For example, with the Post Performance Report and dashboard, you can track all your multi-channel social posts in one place and create comparison reports to communicate their results. Here’s an example of an outbound report:\nAds may not directly affect social media SEO , but paid and organic strategies work together to drive engagement and Pinterest saves. For example, Pinterest ads can help boost brand reach and awareness, indirectly supporting discoverability. Insights from both approaches also reveal emerging trends and consumer intent, helping inform your SEO strategy.\nTo avoid having your paid and organic strategies feel siloed, it’s helpful to develop unified reports that connect them. Sprout, for instance, lets you build reports for your organic Pinterest metrics and compare them to your other social media channels. Then, you can use Pinterest Analytics to look at your organic and paid strategies side by side.\nAccording to the Index, originality leads to better results than simply posting for volume. Users crave authenticity and meaningful connections, and those experiences outperform fleeting trends. Since Pinterest supports longer-lasting content, the more relevant and intentional your Pins are, the more sustained engagement you’ll see.\nMake keyword-rich, buyer-intent descriptions a priority in your Pinterest strategy. Boards and Pins have the potential to appear in both Pinterest and external search engine results.\nBy creating well-optimized boards with relevant Pins, you build indexable content that strengthens your authority and relevance in your target topic areas.\nThe first few minutes after publishing are often the most important, as strong early engagement signals value to Pinterest, increasing your reach and supporting your SEO.\nUsing Sprout’s ViralPost®, you can maximize engagement by posting when your audience is most active. Its AI insights provide optimal send times based on activity, allowing you to schedule your Pins for the best ROI. Here’s how easy it is to schedule posts:\nAdding Pins in your blogs, newsletters and other online assets helps circulate your website content, encouraging organic sharing and impacting overall visibility. This can increase brand awareness, drive direct engagement and even lead to backlinks.\nSome SEOs argue (and case studies support) that increased time on a page can positively influence how well your content ranks on Google . Amplifying your content on Pinterest can drive traffic from qualified users, increasing both engagement and rankings.\nSprout’s Publishing Calendar makes it easy to coordinate the cross-channel effort to share web pages from Pinterest and cross-post to other networks, like this:\nEach Pinterest SEO initiative should support credibility to strengthen E-E-A-T signals to Google and improve business outcomes.

These insights make it easier to align your SEO strategy with measurable business goals.\nSearch is no longer limited to a single platform.
