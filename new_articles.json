    "content": "Previous predictions: 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024\nThis is my 8th time publishing annual predictions. As always, the goal is not to be right but to practice thinking.\nFor example, in 2018, I predicted “Niche communities will be discovered as a great channel for growth” and “Email marketing will return” in 2019. It took another 6 years. That same year, I also wrote “Smart speakers will become a viable user-acquisition channel in 2018”. Well…\nBoost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free !\nFor the past three years, we have lived in the “generative era,” where AI could read the internet and summarize it for us. 2026 marks the beginning of the “agentic era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it – a shift from information retrieval to task execution .\nThis isn’t just a feature update; it is a fundamental restructuring of the digital economy. The web is bifurcating into two distinct layers:\nA big question mark is advertising, where Google’s expansion of ads into AI Mode and ChatGPT showing ads to free users could alleviate pressure on CPCs, but AI Overviews (AIOs) could drive them up. 2026 could be a year of wild price swings where smart teams (your “holistic pods”) move budget daily between Google (high cost/high intent) and ChatGPT (low cost/discovery) to exploit the spread.\nIt is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change.\nPrediction: I forecast an “Extinction Event” in Q3 2026 for the standalone AI visibility tracking category. Rather than a simple consolidation, our analysis shows the majority of pure-play tracking startups might fold or sell for parts as their 2025 funding runways expire simultaneously without the revenue growth to justify Series B rounds.\nPrediction: It’ll be harder for spammers to influence AI visibility in 2026 with link spam, mass-generated AI content, and cloaking. By 2026, agents will likely use Multi-Source Corroboration to eliminate this asymmetry.\nPrediction: AI Overviews (AIOs) scale to 75% of keywords for big sites. AI Mode rolls out to 10-20% of queries.\nPrediction: By 2026, “identity spoofing” will become the single largest cybersecurity risk for public companies. We move from, Is this content real? to Is this source verified?\nPrediction: OpenAI shifts to a hybrid pricing model in 2026: An “ad-supported free tier” and “credit-based pro tier.”\nPrediction: Perplexity will be acquired in late 2026 for $25-$30 billion. After its user growth plateaus at ~50 million MAU, the “unit economics wall” forces a sale to a giant that needs its technology (real-time RAG), not its business model.\nPrediction: Nvidia stock will correct by >20% in 2026 as its largest customers successfully shift 15-20% of their workloads to custom internal silicon. This causes a P/E compression from ~45x to ~30x as the market realizes Nvidia is no longer a monopoly, but a “competitor” in a commoditized market. (Not investment advice!)"

    "content": "What a difference a year makes, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence. Scott Brinker and Frans Riemersma released their “ Martech for 2026 ” report yesterday and the differences between it and the 2025 edition say a lot about how AI and marketing have evolved over the last 12 months.\nHere are five key changes in how AI agents are being used and understood across the marketing landscape.\nLast year, most marketers focused on squeezing more out of their teams and tools. That made sense — AI was new, and the easiest wins were around productivity. Tools for content ideation (used by 69%) and copywriting (62%) were among the most common applications.\nDig deeper: Three actions you must take to thrive in the agentic era of marketing\nToday, the bar is higher. Efficiency is taken for granted. Now the focus is on growth — using AI to drive innovation, unlock new revenue streams and create differentiation. Instead of “do more with less,” it’s “do more with more.” As the 2026 report puts it: “More is not better — better is better.” In other words, it’s not about how much AI you use — it’s about what you do with it.\nIn last year’s report, the main disruption was inside marketing: established vendors vs. upstart AI-native tools, or the challenge of managing ever-expanding martech stacks.\nThis year, the main disruption is outside of marketing’s control: The consumer use of tools like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini for research and buying decisions is turning everything upside down. Half of all consumers already use AI-powered search, putting as much as 50% of traditional search traffic at risk. That’s an enormous power shift.\nTo respond, marketers are beginning to embrace optimizing content for AI engines. Whether you call it AEO for AI engine optimization or GEO for generative engine, it means applying relevant schema types — such as Product, FAQPage, Review and Article — that make details like features, use cases and customer ratings easier for AI to extract and display in results. It’s still early, but the trend is clear: SEO alone won’t get you seen anymore.\nThere was a lot of noise last year about AI replacing martech as we know it. Would AI agents “eat SaaS”? Would traditional platforms become obsolete?\nTurns out, not so much. The data from 2026 shows that most companies are using AI to augment what they already have — not to rip and replace it. In fact, 85.4% of respondents said they’re using AI to enhance existing tools, and just 30.1% reported replacing any major parts of their stack.\nDig deeper: How MOps and CreativeOps can align to unlock operational excellence\nWhat’s emerging is a hybrid model: traditional, rules-based software paired with AI that can reason, generate and adapt. That blend of deterministic and probabilistic systems is fast becoming the new standard.\nIn 2025, the most significant data challenge was getting access to it. Marketers were all about setting up cloud data warehouses, centralizing information and building a universal data layer.\nNow, it’s about ensuring that the data is actually useful. The biggest hurdle in 2026? Poor data quality. More than half of marketers reported struggling with missing, outdated, or inconsistent data. And when AI agents rely on that data to deliver insights, quality matters more than ever.\nTo solve this, marketers are leaning into Context Engineering to ensure AI gets the right inputs at the right time. That includes connecting CRM and CDP data, tapping into DAMs and CMSs and enriching insights with both internal and external signals. Without reliable context, even the smartest AI can get things wrong.\nAI may be changing the role of marketing operations faster than anything else. MOps now has strategic responsibilities in addition to managing tools and ensuring campaigns run on time.\nIn 2026, MOps teams are becoming “business value engineers.” That means translating AI’s potential into outcomes that matter — like top-line growth, customer expansion and strategic insights. It’s a mix of technical know-how, cross-functional collaboration and the ability to turn data into direction.\nIn just a year, marketing has gone from “how do we use this?” to “how do we lead with this?” And expectations for marketing teams are rising accordingly.\nAI is now a new layer in how marketing operates. That means rethinking how stacks are built, customer journeys shaped and teams create value. Like it or not, marketing is becoming the leading change agent for organizations. The rewards and challenges are enormous."
