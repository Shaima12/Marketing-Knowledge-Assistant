Answer engines like ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and Gemini now deliver fully synthesized answers directly to users, compressing the traditional customer journey. According to HubSpot's Consumer Trends Report , 72% of consumers plan to use AI-powered search for shopping more frequently.\nIf your content isn’t structured for or easily parsed by answer engines, your brand won’t appear. Competitors will. Or worse, inaccurate narratives about your company, pulled from sources you don’t associate with, may surface prominently in AI-driven results. That’s a visibility risk no business can afford.\nIn this post, I break down the emerging trends in answer engine optimization, why they matter for revenue, and how to integrate AEO with traditional SEO strategies to drive full-funnel growth.\nAnswer engine optimization matters because search behavior is fundamentally changing: AI Overviews reduce organic clicks but increase the value of citations, and conversational assistants are becoming preferred search options for consumers. HubSpot's Consumer Trends Report reveals that the most significant emotions consumers feel while shopping using generative AI are positive — appreciation, satisfaction, optimism, and joy.\nThe brands that will win in the future of search are those whose content can be cited, summarized, and reused by AI engines. While traditional search remains important and shouldn't be abandoned, neglecting AEO creates significant risks for brand visibility and control.\nAEO efforts can influence perception depending on how well the content appears in AI tools. If the facts about your product, pricing, or differentiators are inconsistent across pages, answer engines are less likely to trust or cite you.\nWhat’s worse is that if your brand doesn’t provide the content, someone else will — an unhappy customer on Reddit, for example.\nMarketing departments must control their product, service, or brand narrative; they must ensure their content is available for AI tools to summarize and deliver to relevant user queries.\nHere’s an example of how third-party sources drive the narrative for HubSpot CRM in AI Overviews:\nI searched for “best free CRM for small business,” and the AI Overviews recommended HubSpot as the top option. The source cited is Zapier. Directly below AI Overviews, HubSpot appears again, first, in “Sources across the web.” Brand trust has been built significantly before the opportunity to click on HubSpot’s traditional SEO listing.\nUsers ask highly specific, high-commercial-intent questions to AI engines — for example, “best ERP for manufacturing under 200 seats”— and answer engines return summarized insights. When content clearly addresses these micro-intents, brands are more likely to appear in answer surfaces.\nUnderstanding micro-intent requires deep audience research. Glimpse's gen AI-enabled research platform supports this approach, recommending that brands address “the concerns and desires of shoppers based on the responses of real consumers.” When marketing teams truly understand their buyers, they can tailor content strategies to support specific needs at precise moments in the decision journey.\nThe “best CRM example” above is also a good example for intent-driven search.\nGlimpse’s gen AI-enabled research platform supports the concept of micro-intent. Glimpse recommended addressing “the concerns and desires of shoppers — based on the responses of real consumers.” When marketing really knows its buyers, they can tailor marketing and content strategies to support them.\nTip: For more guidance on audience research and understanding buyers, see Step 1 How to integrate AEO strategies with SEO for full-funnel growth\nUnlike traditional SEO, where impressions can be broad and unfocused, AEO visibility aligns with precise problem statements. When your insights appear in an AI answer, the user has likely asked a very specific question or typed a particular query, as in the example above.\nFor the searches looking for solutions to a problem, you’re more likely to bring a highly relevant prospect to your website if they do go ahead and click.\nThis has been my experience with AI. Recently, I received an email from a client asking for a Power Hour. I asked where they found me, and it was ChatGPT. This prospect closed after two emails. They gathered all the information they needed from a conversation with ChatGPT and a review of my website. Trust had already been established, and the lead quality was so high that it was easy to close.\nAEO can directly impact revenue. Although many queries typed into AI tools are informational, many are looking for comparisons during the buyer journey phase, when someone wants to make a purchase or even push “buy” on a product.\nWhile these searches might be few and far between, they’re not to be ignored.\nHere’s a screenshot from my client's Looker Studio dashboard where we track conversions from AI:\nConversions from ChatGPT have been increasing since around June, with a notable surge in October, the month we launched additional local pages (more on that next). On this dashboard, we can see exactly which pages ChatGPT has sent the user to and where they converted.\nNote: The URLs are redacted for this article screenshot.\nThe most important answer engine optimization trends in 2026 focus on six strategic areas: leveraging local pages for geographic visibility, implementing answer-first content formats, maintaining entity consistency, tracking AI visibility metrics, unifying AEO with SEO strategies, and optimizing multi-format content, including video and audio. These trends revolve around audience needs, entity clarity, structured answers, and creating content that AI can easily parse, cite, and trust.\nLocal intent is particularly useful for service-based businesses or those with stores, venues, or locations in specific geographic areas. A local search in AI can generate clicks to your website.\nAs mentioned above, people who search using AI are getting specific about what they want and where they need the service. Additionally, AI assistants are increasingly personalizing answers by region, drawing from pages that clearly communicate location, service availability, and entity-level details. Entity clarity supports consistent answers across AI engines.\nLocal pages help AEO because they give answer engines precise, structured information they can extract: what your business does, where the company operates, what it offers, and why you’re relevant for users in that geographic area.\nThis makes local pages strong candidates for citations in AI Overviews, ChatGPT answers, and map-based AI queries.\nImportant note: Do not create false local pages or try to game the algorithm. Less is more when it comes to local pages. Choose locations where your business can actually offer a solid service. Think about office locations or locations that the company regularly serves. Adding things like case studies will increase your expertise, experience, authority, and trust (E-E-A-T) signals.\nHere’s an example of Chipotle’s local page for Kansas City:\nIn my experience, local searches are creating demand for my clients. For example, one client has multiple venues in different locations where they provide services. We’ve built out structured venue pages to capture that demand — and it works. These pages now appear directly in ChatGPT, and more importantly, they convert. We track all conversions through Looker Studio, and the data is clear: well-structured local pages drive both AI visibility and bottom-line results.\nWant more on local? Read my complete guide to local SEO here .\nAI engines prioritise content that surfaces the core answer at the very top of the page. In other words: get to the point as quickly as you can, then elaborate.\nAI systems look for extractable content. When your key message is placed directly under a heading and formatted cleanly, it becomes significantly easier for answer engines to summarise, cite, and reuse it.\nAnswer-first content isn’t exactly new. SEO specialists have been writing in this format for years, probably as early as the featured snippet began dominating the top of Google; nevertheless, it’s worth noting here as an action point because it is perhaps more important than ever to implement this format in content.\nActionable steps to writing answer-first content formats:\nPro Tip: Read about the inverted triangle technique that journalists have used for years; implement it into your writing.\nI have always used this answer-first content method in my content. It’s how I was snagging featured snippets almost a decade ago, and it’s how I make content skimmable for human readers. The answer-first format is almost definitely how I achieved visibility in AI Overviews for my clients. Although this is a format I’ve used for many years, I am still finding ways of doing it more consistently in my writing. It feels more important to do so now.\nThe consistency with which your brand’s entities appear across the web is an emerging trend in AEO.\nHonestly, this always mattered. But it’s worth paying extra attention to brand consistency now. For example, name, services, pricing, product categories, industries served, and differentiators.\nIf these facts are inconsistent across your site, directory listings, or third-party mentions, your authority is questionable, and citation likelihood may decrease.\nOr worse, the AI will pull incorrect information as if it were fact.\nIf you’re moving address, for example, then marketing becomes responsible for updating the details everywhere.\nActionable steps for maintaining entity consistency:\nAs zero-click results surge, traditional KPIs like impressions and rankings tell only half the story. Brands are now shifting toward measurement models that focus on AI visibility metrics — how often a brand is cited, mentioned, or included in an AI-generated answer.\nThis is a major shift in the industry, and it requires a complete search mindset shift . Even if traffic declines, your content can still influence pipeline, authority, and demand if it appears inside AI answers. Measuring AI citations gives marketing teams a clearer view of organic influence in a zero-click world.\nThe AI Search Grader shows how HubSpot performs in three Large Language Models (LLMs), OpenAI, Perplexity, and Gemini, and across a range of metrics, including:\nPro Tip: SEO teams now report on metrics that show the impact of AI on a business's bottom line. For more information on SEO reporting, read: How to create an SEO report [+ benefits, best practices, and examples] . This article covers everything on SEO reporting, including what metrics to track.\nAEO and SEO indeed have some different strategies, but for now, the emerging trend is that AEO is the natural evolution of SEO.\nTraditional SEO, including rankings, traffic, long-tail keywords, backlinks, etc., remains essential, but AEO adds another layer: visibility matters, answer-first optimisation, mentions in AI Overviews, and further onus on structured content, schema, entity clarity, and citation-readiness.\nWinning brands blend both approaches to capture full-funnel visibility across:\nAI engines increasingly pull from multimedia content, not just text. Video transcripts, short video explainers, and even podcasts are now sources that AI systems use to build answers.\nMore notably, Google’s AI Overviews and YouTube AI search features can surface a video and start playback at the exact moment the answer occurs.\nIf someone types into Google, “how to conduct a competitive audit,” the video will be cited, and the play will take place exactly at that section, skipping the intro and other irrelevant chapters.\nWhen creating video content, structure explanations clearly and include timestamped chapters to help AI identify the “best answer moment” in your video.\nActionable steps for earning AEO citations with videos:\nIntegrating AEO with SEO requires aligning five key activities: audience research, answer-first content creation, technical optimization with schema implementation, unified analysis, and continuous measurement. While AEO is more of a search evolution , the two are interconnected disciplines that together drive discovery, evaluation, and conversion across both traditional blue links and AI-generated answer surfaces.\nBy aligning research, content creation, technical optimization, analysis, and measurement, teams can build a unified strategy that attracts high-intent prospects whether or not they click. The steps below outline how to integrate AEO with traditional SEO strategies.\nAEO isn’t about keywords. Contrary to popular belief, ranking in top traditional search spots is not a prerequisite for appearing in AI Overviews or answer engines. AI systems surface the clearest, most contextually relevant answers regardless of traditional search rankings — I've seen websites on page two or three of Google, or even outside the first five pages, appear prominently in AI-generated answers.\nMarketing teams need deep insight into three areas:\nUnderstanding these areas shapes an effective AEO content strategy.\nInstead of relying solely on keyword research, develop detailed buyer personas that reveal decision-making patterns, problem statements, and informational needs. HubSpot Make My Persona helps marketing teams build personas based on real behaviors, goals, and challenges, creating the foundation for highly targeted content.\nSpecificity drives results . I run SEM marketing agency forank with Co-Founder Leigh Buttrey , our in-house PPC specialist. We create holistic campaigns spanning SEO, AEO, and PPC. For one client, we created a landing page targeted at a single buyer type with one specific pain point. The page aligned so closely with audience needs and search intent that it generated a £10k lead from a single visit. That level of precision doesn't happen with generic SEO targeting — it happens when teams build content deliberately for the exact person they want to attract.\nPro tip: Don’t neglect traditional SEO when creating these landing pages. We did, of course, also optimize the page with keywords so it ranked in Google, too. Buttrey also pointed her PPC ads at the page. The page becomes a multi-purpose business asset, not just a page to gain visibility in AI.\nContent is the backbone of AEO. Answer engines can only cite what already exists — AI models do not invent your expertise; they summarise and reorganise it. If your content isn’t present, isn’t structured for extraction, or doesn’t directly address intent, your brand simply won’t appear in AI Overviews or conversational answers. That’s why content creation must be strategic, answer-first, and supported by the right tools.\nHubSpot’s ecosystem makes content creation significantly easier.\nHubSpot Marketing Hub is a marketing suite that helps teams optimise content for both SEO and AEO. It’s a complete marketing platform with built-in SEO tools, optimiz checklists, and performance dashboards. When SEO specialists or writers are writing content, they can rely on Marketing Hub to provide:\nThese alerts ensure your content is structured, findable, and answer-engine ready—bringing SEO and AEO workflows together in one place.\nCombine all the benefits of Marketing Hub with an AI enhancement from Breeze Content Assistant , and the content is going to have the best chance of ranking on Google and AI engines. Breeze already generates answer-first content aligned with AEO best practices.\nMarketing teams are using Breeze to create content faster and more consistently, and to generate summaries, definitions, FAQs, and scannable insights that AI engines can easily parse and cite. It reduces manual editing and enforces a clear, extraction-friendly structure.\nRemember: When a page ranks number one and also appears in AI Overviews, it occupies multiple placements above the fold — often dominating more than half of the visible SERP. This is the fastest way to capture high-intent visibility.\nI had a client secure both a rank-one placement and an AI Overview placement. Within the AI Overview, they were cited multiple times. As a result, the brand appeared five or six times at the top of Google. When AEO and SEO work together, a single high-performing page can effectively take over the entire first page of Google.\nEven the most brilliant content won’t appear in AI answers if models can’t parse it.\nTechnical optimization ensures your site can be crawled, understood, and trusted by answer engines. The most important elements are structured data/schema markup, entity clarity, and clean technical signals.\nStructured data and schema markup enable answer engines to verify facts, map relationships between entities, and extract accurate answers. Schema markup and entity consistency strengthen your authority inside the AI knowledge graph.\nEntity clarity ensures consistency in messaging across the web, making it more likely that citations will be accurate.\nClean technical signals ensure that bots for traditional search tools, like Google, can crawl the site and index content.\nAEO must be included in all SEO audits and reports. Typically, AEO measurement focuses on AI citations, mention quality, and assisted conversions\nJust as SEO teams evaluate rankings, backlinks, Core Web Vitals, and keyword performance, AEO teams need to assess how your brand appears — or doesn’t appear — within AI-generated results.\nPro tip: Add AEO to your standard SEO reporting cadence. Treat AI visibility as seriously as rankings.\nI added AI to my client’s Looker Studio report some time ago. As shown in the pictures below, we track:\nAI Performance overall, including pages viewed, sessions, and AI tools sending traffic:\nConversions showing exactly how many conversions were made and how (form, phone, or email):\nAEO success cannot rely on clicks alone — because many of the most valuable interactions are zero-click. Instead, measure AI visibility, the quality of your citations, and the conversions influenced by AI exposure.\nTraditional SEO metrics don’t tell the whole story in a zero-click world. AI-generated answers influence decisions long before a user ever lands on your site, so AEO success must be measured through visibility, influence, and revenue impact.\nThe most accurate AEO measurement models focus on how often your brand appears in AI-generated answers, how those exposures influence behaviour, and whether the content being cited drives high-quality demand.\nBelow are the core AI visibility metrics every team should track.\nAI tools change their answers regularly, so no one can know exactly what page is being cited and when. However, marketing teams can track sessions to specific pages. Tracking which pages are being viewed—and how often—helps marketing teams understand where AI is pulling information from and how often. The pages that get clicked the most from an AI source are likely to be frequently cited.\nPages that are frequently viewed—especially those not ranking one are often the ones surfacing heavily in AI models. Identifying these pages helps marketing strategists strengthen AEO-focused content clusters.\nPro tip: Kyle Rushton McGregor has a fantastic guide and free Looker Studio dashboard to help track AI visits .\nAlthough visibility is important, especially in an AI search era, conversions and revenue will always matter the most.\nMarketing teams must measure conversions from AI traffic and revenue generated. Conversions are measured by tracking where people came from and what happened during that session. For example, if someone came from ChatGPT and filled out a contact form, then that’s a conversion attributable, either entirely or in part, to AEO.\nWhen I measure conversions, I take steps to make attribution and impact measurable. For example, I add a “budget” question on forms so I can see what the prospect has to spend. In the example of the 10k lead from ChatGPT, I knew what the budget was because the form they filled out asked for it.\nThere is something else to consider, but it is harder to measure precisely: even when users don’t click through from an AI Overview or conversational answer, those citations still influence their decision-making. That’s why conversion analysis remains one of the most critical AEO metrics.\nPro tip: Track conversion paths in HubSpot to identify where AEO visibility accelerates pipeline velocity.\nTracking which pages convert — and whether those pages also appear in AI answers — gives a complete view of AEO’s role in revenue generation. Pages with high conversion rates and AI visibility are your strongest assets.\nThe combination of AEO visibility and conversion performance tells which content is actually driving results. These pages should be prioritized for updates, schema enhancements, link building, and ongoing AEO optimization.\nAEO doesn’t just increase visibility; it enhances the type of visibility received. When your content appears in hyper-relevant AI answers, the leads that follow are often warmer and better aligned to your ICP.\nAI-driven discovery tends to attract more qualified prospects because the answer engine has already filtered for intent. High-quality leads are a signal that your answer-first content and entity clarity are working.\nPro tip: Use HubSpot lead scoring to compare AI-influenced leads with standard organic leads.\nThe impact of AEO updates typically appears within 2-6 weeks, with brands that have invested in SEO often seeing results even faster. Many brands are already cited in AI Overviews, or within Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Perplexity, thanks to their previous SEO efforts. There are a lot of crossovers between what works for SEO and what works for the latest AI trends .\nFor brands starting from scratch, early signals, like a citation for a niche search term, may be visible within two to six weeks. This has been my experience with a client who hadn’t previously invested in SEO. Two weeks after publishing a long-form, informational article, the client appeared in AI Overviews.\nSeparate AEO content is usually unnecessary — most AEO work involves restructuring and strengthening existing website content. Effective AEO optimization includes adding answer-first summaries at the top of pages, standardizing facts and product descriptions for consistency, improving schema markup for better extraction, adding FAQs based on real user intent, and ensuring headings match how people phrase questions in conversational search.\nThis approach maximizes existing content investments while improving visibility across both traditional search and AI answer engines.\nChoose answer engine optimization strategies that improve websites for both users and AI by focusing on extractability, consistency, and authority. Effective strategies include building answer-first formatting that surfaces key information early, strengthening entity clarity across all pages, adding schema markup to priority content, creating content that directly addresses user questions, and prioritizing topics tied to revenue, conversion intent, and ideal customer profile pain points.\nAEO isn’t about chasing every query — it’s about identifying the topics where your brand must appear because they influence pipeline, positioning, and perception.\nIntegrate AEO with existing SEO roadmaps by updating processes rather than replacing them. Add answer-first sections to existing SEO pages, include schema as a standard part of content production, audit entity consistency during technical SEO checks, and evaluate both traditional rankings and AI citations in reporting. Treat AEO as the “zero-click layer” of SEO strategy.\nThink of AEO as the evolution of SEO: one unified strategy where content ranks and gets cited.\nStart with tools that support creation, optimiz, and monitoring:\nTogether, these tools help you create structured, answer-ready content and track how well you’re surfacing across both traditional SERPs and AI engines.\nAnswer engine optimization is reshaping how customers discover, evaluate, and choose solutions in 2026. The brands investing in AEO now will earn disproportionate attention, trust, and demand as AI-powered search continues to grow.\nTools like HubSpot's AI Search Grader benchmark current performance across answer engines, while HubSpot Marketing Hub and Content Hub with Breeze Content Assistant help teams build, optimize, and measure answer-first content at scale. From my experience, AEO delivers impactful wins despite zero-click growth — the key is focusing efforts on the right pages and tracking AI-influenced conversions alongside traditional metrics."
