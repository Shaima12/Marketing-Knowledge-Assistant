    "content": "Over the last five years, the business world has undergone a more dramatic transformation than it did in the entire decade before. Just as companies were adapting to permanent shifts in workplace dynamics, consumer behavior, and global economics — all sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic — generative AI emerged. This delivered a shock to business comparable to the internet revolution of the 1990s.\nCompanies that once led the digital transformation now face an unexpected reality: their hard-won advantages are evaporating as competitors leverage AI to match the capabilities of much larger, better-funded teams.\nThe playing field hasn‘t just leveled. It’s been completely redrawn.\nThrough months of market research focused on customer needs, HubSpot uncovered how growth-driving teams are responding to this new environment. They’re abandoning linear playbooks in favor of go-to-market strategies that operate in an infinite Loop — a continuously adapting cycle of learning, experimenting, optimizing, and scaling.\nA 2025 study of 1,800 brand professionals (including marketers, advertisers, content strategists, brand specialists, and GTM decision-makers) identified key tactics that brands are using to get ahead in the eye of dramatic tech transformation. These insights form what HubSpot calls The Loop Marketing Landscape.\nThis may sound pretty obvious, but it’s far from a given. While every marketing textbook harps on the importance of documenting a unique value proposition (UVP), HubSpot found that only half (51%) of global marketers actually have one.\nWhen you compare overall goal attainment (in the past year) across respondents, 52% of marketers on goal-exceeding teams had a clearly defined and documented UVP. Only 36% of teams who just hit their targets (without regularly exceeding) did. And just 24% of respondents who regularly missed their goals did.\nThe connection is clear: If your own teams can’t articulate what makes you valuable, your customers won’t get it either. Misalignment across marketing, sales, product, and leadership can quickly lead to inconsistent messaging in the market.\nEvery brand identity should amplify how your business uniquely solves for the customer (and outshines the competition). Respondents with clearly documented brand positioning leaned into the following best practices when developing and refining their own:\nIn the Loop framework, brand positioning becomes the anchor that every iteration loops back to.\nWhile most global respondents use some form of personalization in their marketing or advertising content, 50% aren't going any deeper than inserting a name, company, or address token.\nOnly 25% said they segmented audiences by easy-to-find demographics, such as gender, country, or industry. And only 15% were segmenting or personalizing content tailored to the buyer personas (groups or targets) most likely to buy their products.\nLet's face it. Contact tokens are cute, but they aren’t captivating.\nAs marketing teams gain broad access to generative AI, basic personalization is no longer a differentiator in the market — it’s the standard. What actually moves customers to take action is content that speaks directly to their needs, motivations, and buying behaviors.\nYou can't create tailored content without first knowing who you’re speaking to and where they spend their time.\nOf the respondents with personalization tactics in motion, basic demographic data (43%) and shopping habits (36%) were most valuable to them when determining:\nOnce you've built out buyer personas for your target audiences, start identifying the channels they use and what types of affordable, personalized or segmented experiences you can provide to them.\nTwo channels that respondents said their brands regularly use for personalized or segmented content were email (61%) and paid media, such as website or social ads (47%) .\nIn the Loop model, personalization is how brands learn in real time, feed insights back into the system, and refine the next iteration of content.\nThe web landscape is always changing and evolving, particularly with the expansion of generative AI. As new channels emerge and gain virality, others can drop in effectiveness or ROI within weeks or months.\nIt‘s easy to see one channel doing well and become complacent, thinking you can just lean into it forever. But that’s not how today's world works.\nIn the past 12 months, for example, web brands that invested most of their resources in SEO experienced significant ROI downturns when Google's AI Overviews unexpectedly led to 60% fewer search result clicks to other websites.\nThat's likely one of many reasons why 48% of respondents now say their brand allocates more than one-fifth of its budget to channel experimentation and diversification.\nWhen looking at the data, these channel expansion opportunities stood out the most:\nDiversification ensures that if one part of your Loop falters, the rest of your strategy stays in motion.\nAs brands adapt to a world where AI accelerates the pace of change, the businesses that win are those that can continuously learn, adapt, and refresh their strategy.\nThat’s the power of Loop Marketing : it turns growth into a perpetual cycle rather than a one-time roadmap.\nTeams that consistently exceed their goals aren’t relying on static playbooks. They are:\nTo learn more about these findings and how to build a strong Loop Marketing playbook, read the full report here."

    "title": "6 marketing priorities leaders will obsess over in 2026",
    "date": "2025-12-09T15:00:05+00:00",
    "content": "Marketing isn’t the same as it was five years ago, or even last year. Traditional search is dying, website traffic is falling fast and email engagement is sliding. Instead, social media is where consumers now turn to learn about new brands, to find product recommendations from creators, to get customer support and—most importantly—where they spend their time in today’s attention economy.\nWhat it means to be a marketing leader is changing, and the stakes are high. Especially because consumers are price sensitive, with ever-increasing expectations for the brands they buy from. Executives and board members want to see proof of ROI in light of tight budgets. 65% of CMOs say AI will completely change their job in the next two years, even if they don’t know exactly how yet. Creating a competitive advantage on social is getting harder. Internal teams are battling burnout and bandwidth constraints, while still being asked to do more with less.\nWith so many concerns, where do you go from here? To help you identify your most strategic focus areas and lead a social-first marketing team , we’ve curated a list of the six most pressing marketing priorities you should have on your radar in 2026.\nAccording to the Q2 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey , social is now the #1 place Gen Z searches—more than Google and other traditional search engines. With consumers of all ages increasingly turning to Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, YouTube and more to find curated answers from real people, content discoverability is crucial.\nMore than half of marketing leaders already have a dedicated social search (SOSEO) strategy, per The 2025 Impact of Social Media Report. In the year ahead, 81% of marketing leaders anticipate reallocating funds from traditional SEO to organic, paid social or influencer marketing.\nSocial has become the front door for product discovery. Showing up where your audience already seeks information isn’t a matter of completely overhauling your strategy—but it will require different skills, better tooling and closer orchestration across your marketing org. Staying on top of audience trends through social listening, partnering with topically relevant influencers and iterating content faster are all necessary to mastering SOSEO .\nAt Sprout, SOSEO is a shared responsibility, with our social, content and SEO teams each playing a role. We’ve developed network-specific strategies to amplify content reach, including producing educational long-form YouTube videos, jumping in on relevant subreddit conversations and using social listening insights to publish real-time content around trending cultural moments, like Coachella, the Met Gala, Cannes and holiday shopping.\nConsiderations: What resources would allow your team to be more proactive about producing content to match rising AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and SOSEO search intent, rather than reacting to search behavior that’s already peaked? Remember, SOSEO isn’t just about making your social posts more discoverable, it’s also about optimizing your web content, customer reviews and more.\nInfluencers and creators are the modern way to reach audiences, and their content dramatically outperforms most content that comes directly from brands. 92% of marketers say that on average, sponsored influencer content performs better in terms of reach compared to organic content posted on their brand accounts, per the Q1 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey . Over two-thirds say they already rely on influencer marketing to increase brand awareness, audience engagement, credibility and trust, and even revenue.\nThe same survey found that most brands focus their partnerships on 10 influencers or fewer—even though they wish they worked with more. To grow and scale effectively, marketing teams must overcome common hurdles like unclear ownership, budget constraints and inefficient processes.\nSprout Social CMO Scott Morris describes how we did this at Sprout: “We transformed a handful of ad hoc influencer activations into a robust influencer marketing program that sits at the center of our marketing strategy. Rather than placing the responsibility solely on the social team, we built a cross-functional influencer and creator marketing machine that spans many departments and functions—and that has been one of the keys to our success. The result: Partnerships with dozens of unique creators and hundreds of pieces of content that drove more than 4 million impressions, 100K+ engagements and a large volume of leads (not to mention a Silver Honor Shorty Award ) .”\nAnd influencers are not limited to creators outside of your organization. People want to hear from other people, which includes both your company’s employees and leadership. At Sprout, we created an internal creator program to produce employee-driven content, and have an employee advocacy program that enables every team member to share Sprout news, product launches and articles.\nConsiderations: To go from one-off partnerships to building a sophisticated influencer marketing strategy , you need to align your efforts with clear business goals, and define metrics that are tied to core business KPIs. Which teams need clearer roles and responsibilities? Where do manual tasks slow your team down? What meaningful data insights are you missing?\nConsumers have never been so plugged into social, or eager to see brand content. But, as mentioned before, brands compete in an attention economy , and teams are on the brink of burnout (if they aren’t already there). It’s imperative to use audience insights to determine how to craft the right content for the right channels.\nWhile there is a place for everyone and every brand on social, that doesn’t mean you need to be everywhere. Real-time audience insights make it clear where your team should concentrate—rather than expecting teams to balance content across every available network. As algorithms evolve, networks diversify and the battle for attention intensifies, your team needs actionable learnings to stay ahead of the competition and exceed consumer expectations.\nIt’s important to remember that insights from social are invaluable to teams across your company, not just the marketing team. Social intelligence is a source of truth that will help your company refine product development, strengthen your employer brand and recruit top talent, and directly drive revenue gains. Used correctly, social insights make it easy to prove organization-wide value, facilitate cross-collaboration and ensure customer care, sales, HR and R&D buy-in on your initiatives.\nSprout’s VP of Social Intelligence Evangelism, Brittany Hennesy, put it best, “Social intelligence is the act of harnessing the unfiltered, real-time pulse of your market from social media and embedding that insight into how your business operates. It’s building a direct line to customer behavior, expectations and emotions at scale. It means capturing billions of conversations and turning them into a predictive operating system that informs everything from strategy to product development.”\nConsiderations: If you want to build a marketing strategy that prioritizes your customers and future customers, you need to put social intelligence at the center of it. Does your current tech stack make social data accessible? Are you on the pulse of market and consumer sentiment shifts? How quickly do you make decisions grounded in real-world behavior?\nAI content creation is expected to be everywhere in 2026, but brands that partake risk eroding consumer trust. When we asked global consumers what their top concerns were related to brands on social media, their #1 answer was companies posting AI-generated content without disclosing it, per Sprout’s Q3 2025 Pulse Survey.\nOn the other hand, brands that prioritize human-generated content will endear consumers. 55% of social users said they are more likely to trust brands that publish human-generated content, and this rises to two-thirds of Gen Z and Millennials, according to the Q3 Pulse Survey.\nAccording to Sprout’s Q4 2025 Pulse Survey, consumers event went as far to say the #1 effort they want brands to prioritize in 2026 is crafting human-generated content.\nMorris adds, “AI drives a new premium on authenticity . The flood of easily generated content and deepfakes will push consumers to seek out content that feels human-generated and real, shifting authenticity from a brand differentiator to a prerequisite for engagement.”\nBut that doesn’t mean consumers are against teams using AI in their workflows. The Q4 Pulse Survey also found that 69% of users are comfortable with companies using AI chatbots and tools to help humans refine their responses to deliver faster customer service on social. That’s true for 78% of Gen Z and Millennials. Marketers should also lean on AI to automate tedious data extraction, making it possible to embed social intelligence across your business.\nConsiderations: AI is not a replacement for human taste or creativity. Audiences are already fatigued by “AI slop.” But AI can and should play a critical role in empowering teams and enabling meaningful productivity. What are the tedious tasks AI could take off your team’s plate? How could AI tools tear down silos? What could AI help you learn about your audience?\nProviding customer service on social is already non-negotiable. When a brand is unresponsive to customer outreach on social, 49% of users admit only sometimes try reaching out on traditional channels. 19% never will, per the Q2 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey.\nBut to truly stand out for the right reasons, marketers must provide exceptional customer experiences rooted in joy. The economic and political upheaval of the past year (and beyond) have left people seeking out positive interactions more than ever.\nThe Q4 2025 Pulse Survey found that personalized customer service experiences and surprise-and-delight moments are tied for second when it comes to efforts consumers say brands should prioritize in 2026. That could include sending users a free product or custom gift based on a user’s post, like the famous return of Lamby by Marriott Hotels in January 2025.\nPrioritizing your customers’ experience on social influences how the world (and future customers) see your brand. More than any other trait, social users say the boldest, most standout companies are honest, per the same Q2 survey. If you say you value your customers, consumers will look to social to prove you mean it.\nConsiderations: The mantra “the customer is always right” has been repeated for over a century. What does it mean in a modern context? At a time when every brand claims to prioritize satisfaction, exceptional care means being “available” 24/7, anticipating needs before they arise and creating one-of-a-kind moments on a global stage. Do you have the team structure and tools to make that a reality?\nThe expectations placed on social marketing roles are more complex than ever, which means the need for specialization is ratcheting up. According to The 2025 Impact of Social Media Report, more than 50% of marketing leaders say they want to hire for specialized roles—including social media search optimization, social customer service and support, paid social, influencer marketing, and social analytics and listening.\nAs roles evolve, so too must marketing team structures. While there’s no one-size-fits-all social media team structure , marketing org charts should reflect the growing demands of the work, and the unique needs of your business and audience. It’s time to do away with Swiss Army knife-style roles, where one social marketer is doing the work of five. Leaders need to advocate for team structures that offer clear paths for career progression and work-life balance, and prioritize the work that correlates most with business growth.\nWhen we asked Sprout’s Social Media Intelligence Manager, Olivia Jepson, about the move toward role specialization in the social industry, she observed, “Clinging to generalist-only roles will lead to burnout and churn. The boldest leaders are betting on specialization and they are beating their competition. Other marketing teams have specialized roles. Why not social?”\nConsiderations: Maintaining your brand’s competitive edge and reaping the most rewards from social starts with investing in the professionals that help shape your brand perception. Start by taking a discerning look at your team today. What skills and capabilities are you missing? If you have a team of generalists, find out what they love most about their role and help them grow in that direction through mentorship and continued education. Use an opportunity cost framework (“our team could do X, if we had Y”) to make the case to leadership to invest in both professional development for your existing team and hiring for specialized roles.\nThe pressures you feel are real: shrinking budgets, rising expectations, AI acceleration and an increasingly fragmented digital landscape. But so are the opportunities. From embracing SOSEO to embedding social intelligence across your business, to rebuilding your team for a social-first world, there are steps you can take to give your organization an edge.\n2026 won’t reward teams who try to do everything. It will reward teams who invest in the right things. The leaders who succeed will be those who build agile, insight-driven, human-centered marketing organizations ready to evolve as fast as their audiences do.\nTo help you turn these priorities into a concrete, actionable strategy, download the 2026 CMO Planning Guide , your blueprint for building a high-performing, future-ready marketing org."
