However, they’re often treated like commodities rather than recognized for the power they hold.\nWords are a vehicle for connection, for understanding and for inspiration. A single change in phrasing can turn flat marketing speak into something that grabs attention, shifts perspectives and drives action.\nBelow are the essentials of compelling copywriting across marketing channels and how to craft messages that spark interest in readers.\nThere are several enduring best practices in copywriting. They are channel-agnostic and should be considered by any brand, writer or marketer getting their start in copywriting.\nBefore you write a word, you need to identify who you’re talking to and what you want them to do. Without that, at best, you are guessing what your readers want. At worst, you’ll completely miss the mark or even deter customers.\nKnowing your audience starts by researching your audience’s pain points. This can be as simple as talking to past or prospective customers or sending out surveys. A few questions I like to ask include:\nSpeak with or survey at least 10 people, ideally more. Once you have some consensus on what your audience cares about and needs, your copy should speak to those goals.\nWrite each line of copy to lead toward the next. Sentences should pull a reader forward. Ask yourself, “Does this make them want to read the next line?” If not, rework it.\nHere, there’s no flow and no reason for the reader to keep reading. The copy lists facts instead of creating curiosity or momentum. Readers can stop at any point because nothing is pulling them forward.\nThat is an excellent example because each line sets up the next. There’s curiosity (“tools that promised simplicity”), intrigue (“one that actually works with you”) and payoff (“in just five minutes”). It gently guides the reader from problem → solution → benefit → action.\nTension, curiosity or a promise can help build and maintain that momentum in your copy.\nWriting about how great your brand is will only get you so far. Prospective customers only care if you solve their problem. If your copy isn’t focused primarily on what the reader wants and needs, you will lose them in the features and overly promotional details.\nThis copy is too brand-centered. It talks way too much about the company rather than the customer. There’s no mention of what the reader actually gains or how their life improves as a result of the product.\nThis copy is clearly reader-centered. It starts with the customer’s pain (“wasting hours”), offers a direct benefit (“automates the busywork”) and ends with a clear emotional payoff. It speaks about the reader, not at them.\nDon’t lose prospective customers in the details. While you want to accurately describe your offer, you don’t need to be overly verbose. Communicating your point in fewer words is a win.\nClarity always beats clutter. Your tone should be straightforward and conversational, rather than stiff or stuffed with jargon. The goal is to make your message crystal clear to your readers.\nThe latter uses clear, everyday language to make the point. It’s easier to understand and, as a result, more actionable. It centers the reader’s benefit and says what the previous example did — only in fewer words.\nWhen you have the opportunity to show readers what you can do for them, seize it. Words have limits. Skip redundancy and self-promotion and let social proof reveal what your brand is about.\nCustomer data, case studies and testimonials supply the credibility people want before they buy. A customer vouching for your product is far more convincing than a brand saying, “We’re great.” Use social proof in place of lengthy copy to build trust and tap into the emotional triggers that drive decisions.\nAlthough these best practices apply to all copywriting, the format will vary by platform. Some types of copy — such as long-form, short-form, video and ads — perform better in specific channels.\nLearn the tone, format and layout that work best on the platform you’re using. For instance:\nDo a quick scan of each channel to see what performs, what competitors are doing and how you can position your content to stand out.\nYour copy needs to adapt to each platform’s purpose and the specific behavior of your target audience. Here’s how to craft compelling copy for today’s most important marketing channels.\nA sales page is usually where people land at the end of your funnel — whether they arrive through an ad, email or social campaign. Its only job is to sell one product, service or offer. It shouldn’t be a copy-and-paste version of your product or service page. Prospective customers expect a different experience here.\nA sales page is built to sell, so open with a sharp, relevant hook. Then build value by highlighting clear benefits. Write to spark curiosity and create a link between what you offer and what your customer needs.\nThere’s no perfect template, but this general progression works well:\nFor example, if I were writing a sales page for a course on SEO for small business owners, the copy might follow a structure like this — without drafting the full page:\n“Are you spending a bunch of time on SEO but not seeing any results?\nWhat if you could attract new customers every month without burning out or wasting money?\nIn Small Biz SEO Academy, I teach small business owners like you how to build a fully automated “SEO funnel” in a weekend — with no monthly SEO fee or hours spent optimizing your website.\n– My Tried and Tested Method for Generating Tons of Customers Every Month, Used by Businesses of All Sizes\n– A No-Brainer Approach to SEO — No Fancy Skills or Coding Needed\n– Minimize Time Spent on Marketing Down to Less Than 5 Hours Per Month!\n– Generate $3,000-$10,000 in Revenue Per Month, All with Organic\n– 5 Ready-to-Use Templates (Just Edit and Publish!)\n– 6 Straightforward Videos on How to Build Your Own SEO Funnel\nSee how Sarah and Todd increased their monthly revenue after implementing Small Biz SEO Academy!

And by email campaigns, I mean sales emails — not your monthly newsletter.\nStart by defining the purpose and cadence of the campaign.\nThen outline your sequence. A simple, effective progression might look like this:\nTry not to overthink your subject lines. Test them and see what resonates — every audience responds differently. Use a conversational tone and “you” language, avoiding jargon and salesy “we” phrasing.\nAlso resist sending readers in several directions. One clear idea and one clear CTA per email works best. For strong examples, search for email swipe files. Many marketers share templates you can study or adapt and Ben Settle’s swipe files are a solid place to start.\nDigital ads demand speed. You have only a moment to earn someone’s attention before they scroll past. Your copy must get to the point fast and create enough intrigue for the reader to want more. The best ad copy doesn’t try to say everything. It says the one thing your audience needs to hear most — right now.\nFor example, imagine you’re running a Facebook ad for your content marketing software. Rather than saying:\nThis copy is short and to the point and says precisely what it needs to say. It also speaks directly to an emotional pain point (“stress”), which is often more powerful than listing features or technical details.\nYou have limited time and space in digital ads. Instead of listing features, paint a picture of what life is like after someone uses your product. Lead with the emotional payoff — more time, more clarity, more revenue, less frustration — and then land the benefit.\nAds come in many formats, from text to carousels to video, so your structure will need to adapt accordingly. But every ad needs a scroll-stopping hook, a clear promise that speaks to the user and a strong CTA.\nFrom there, send users to a sales page that does the heavy lifting. An ad isn’t meant to close the sale but to start the journey. Your job is to earn the click and spark curiosity. Do that well and the next step feels natural.\nFor strong examples, browse Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Study how brands hook you, how their sales pages flow and how often they use CTAs. Once you start noticing sales funnels, you’ll see them everywhere. Funnel hacking is excellent practice for any marketer or copywriter wanting to sharpen their craft.\nDig deeper: A 3-step copywriting formula that makes buyers take action\nSome brands write their web pages like sales pages, but that approach misfires. People land on your site from all stages of the buying journey and hitting them with hard sales copy right away feels too aggressive.\nYour website is your digital storefront — the place where visitors decide whether they trust you enough to buy, work with you or look elsewhere. Your copy should build trust, share clear information and highlight your credibility.\nThink of your homepage as a handshake: simple, welcoming and informative. As visitors move deeper into your site, your copy should expand your value, answer their unspoken questions and reduce friction at every step.\nEvery page should make it obvious what you do, who you help and how you stand apart. Readers shouldn’t have to decode sales language or hunt for basic information.\nEvery page should make clear what you do, who you help and how you’re different. Readers shouldn’t have to decode sales language oEvery page should make clear what you do, who you help and how you’re different. Readers shouldn’t have to decipher sales language or search for the basics. That’s why your website needs a structure very different from a sales page.\nPeople don’t read websites the way they read emails or ads — they skim. Your job is to guide them through a clear hierarchy, with useful subheadings and a logical flow that leads them exactly where they need to go.\nAgain, your web page copy exists to build trust. You still want to highlight benefits and encourage action, but it doesn’t need to be as tight as an ad or as sales-forward as a sales page. Aim for a balance: tap into emotional triggers while giving readers detailed, accurate information they can rely on.\nThere’s a key difference between social media content (posts, Reels, Stories, etc.) and social media ad copy. The first is for organic engagement and audience connection. The second is to sell. Here, I’m talking about copy for social ads.\nSocial platforms — Instagram, Facebook, X, Reddit and others — are places where brands show personality and build connection. Your copy shouldn’t be stiff or overly polished. The best social copy feels conversational.\nThink about how these platforms began: spaces for people to share updates, connect with friends and join communities. User-generated content has always set the tone. Your job as an advertiser is to blend into that environment with a natural, friendly voice while still stopping the scroll.\nYour first line matters most. This is your hook. Lead with a sharp question, a hint of a story, an unexpected stat or an inside joke. Your visuals should also help create that scroll-stopping moment.\nNext, paint a picture of the transformation your product or service delivers. How do you take someone from A to B? If you can convey this with a quick story, even better.\nThen, close with a clear CTA. This is not the place for vague or quirky lines like “Discover your adventure.” Clearly state what users will receive when they click.\nFor example, if I were writing an Instagram ad for a luxury shoe brand ahead of Thanksgiving, I might say:\nEach platform leans a bit differently — LinkedIn feels more authoritative, Instagram more emotional, Facebook more community-driven, X more punchy — but all reward clarity and relatability. When your copy sounds like it was written by a real person, engagement rises naturally.\nSpend time studying ads on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and other platforms. Notice how brands hook attention and drive action.\nSearch ads — such as Google Ads and Bing Ads — target customers who are actively seeking a product or service. As a result, your copy should be keyword-focused and direct.\nSay you’re a restoration company offering mold remediation services in NYC. A prospective customer might search terms like “mold remediation NYC,” “mold removal service near me,” “professional mold remediation,” or “mold cleanup services.”\nWith those keywords driving intent, your ad copy should use them clearly and naturally. And to do that well, you need to understand how each part of a search ad works:\nAssuming we use all of the features available to us and write a fully optimized ad, it might look something like this:\nHeadline: New York Mold Removal Service — NY Certified Mold Inspectors\nDescription: [Brand] Mold Removal is a NY Top-Rated Mold Company. Let Our Techs Clean The Mold For You!\nSince this structure is more formulaic, many marketers and business owners find it easier than creative copywriting. The example above illustrates how search ads can closely align with a user’s intent and enhance relevance through the strategic use of clear keywords.\nWrite several ads within the same ad group and test different headlines, descriptions and extensions to see what performs best.\nAs you’ve likely noticed, copywriting isn’t as simple as following a template. What works for one brand may fall flat for another. Studying other brands helps, but the only real way to get good is to practice and test what your audience responds to.\nStart by understanding what your audience wants and the challenges they face. Market research is essential — don’t skip it. Let your audience tell you what they want to read and what will inspire them to take action.\nNext, learn how copy is formatted on different platforms and how users interact with each one. A style that thrives on LinkedIn may flop on Instagram and vice versa. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach.\nThe best copywriters research their audience, learn the platform, refine their copy across formats and then test. The truth of your efforts shows up in the data. Don’t overthink it — let performance guide your decisions."
