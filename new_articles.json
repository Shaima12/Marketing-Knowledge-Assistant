    "date": "2025-12-08T12:30:24+00:00",
    "content": "A few weeks ago, I was given access to review a confidential OpenAI partner-facing report , the kind of dataset typically made available to a small group of publishers.\nFor the first time, from the report, we have access to detailed visibility metrics from inside ChatGPT, the kind of data that only a select few OpenAI site partners have ever seen.\nThis isn’t a dramatic “leak,” but rather an unusual insight into the inner workings of the platform, which will influence the future of SEO and AI-driven publishing over the next decade.\nThe consequences of this dataset far outweigh any single controversy: AI visibility is skyrocketing, but AI-driven traffic is evaporating.\nThis is the clearest signal yet that we are leaving the era of “search engines” and entering the era of “decision engines,” where AI agents surface, interpret, and synthesize information without necessarily directing users back to the source.\nThis forces every publisher, SEO professional, brand, and content strategist to fundamentally reconsider what online visibility really means.\nThe report dataset gives a large media publisher a full month of visibility. With surprising granularity, it breaks down how often a URL is displayed inside ChatGPT, where it appears inside the UI, how often users click on it, how many conversations it impacts, and the surface-level click-through rate (CTR) across different UI placements.\nThe dataset’s top-performing URL recorded 185,000 distinct conversation impressions, meaning it was shown in that many separate ChatGPT sessions.\nOf these impressions, 3,800 were click events, yielding a conversation-level CTR of 2%. However, when counting multiple appearances within conversations, the numbers increase to 518,000 total impressions and 4,400 total clicks, reducing the overall CTR to 0.80%.\nThis is an impressive level of exposure. However, it is not an impressive level of traffic.\nThis is not a one-off anomaly; it’s consistent across the entire dataset and matches external studies, including server log analyses by independent SEOs showing sub-1% CTR from ChatGPT sources.\nWe have experienced this phenomenon before, but never on this scale. Google’s zero-click era was the precursor. ChatGPT is the acceleration. However, there is a crucial difference: Google’s featured snippets were designed to provide quick answers while still encouraging users to click through for more information. In contrast, ChatGPT’s responses are designed to fully satisfy the user’s intent, rendering clicks unnecessary rather than merely optional.\nThe report breaks down every interaction into UI “surfaces,” revealing one of the most counterintuitive dynamics in modern search behavior. The response block, where LLMs place 95%+ of their content, generates massive impression volume, often 100 times more than other surfaces. However, CTR hovers between 0.01% and 1.6%, and curiously, the lower the CTR, the better the quality of the answer.\nThis is the new equivalent of “Position Zero,” except now it’s not just zero-click; it’s zero-intent-to-click. The psychology is different from that of Google. When ChatGPT provides a comprehensive answer, users interpret clicking as expressing doubt about the AI’s accuracy, indicating the need for further information that the AI cannot provide, or engaging in academic verification (a relatively rare occurrence). The AI has already solved its problem.\nThe sidebar tells a different story. This small area has far fewer impressions, but a consistently strong CTR ranging from 6% to 10% in the dataset. This is higher than Google’s organic positions 4 through 10. Users who click here are often exploring related content rather than verifying the main answer. The sidebar represents discovery mode rather than verification mode. Users trust the main answer, but are curious about related information.\nCitations at the bottom of responses exhibit similar behavior, achieving a CTR of between 6% and 11% when they appear. However, they are only displayed when ChatGPT explicitly cites sources. These attract academically minded users and fact-checkers. Interestingly, the presence of citations does not increase the CTR of the main answer; it may actually decrease it by providing verification without requiring a click.\nSearch results are rarely triggered and usually only appear when ChatGPT determines that real-time data is needed. They occasionally show CTR spikes of 2.5% to 4%. However, the sample size is currently too small to be significant for most publishers, although these clicks represent the highest intent when they occur.\nThe paradox is clear: The more frequently OpenAI displays your content, the fewer clicks it generates. The less frequently it displays your content, the higher the CTR. This overturns 25 years of SEO logic. In traditional search, high visibility correlates with high traffic. In AI-native search, however, high visibility often correlates with information extraction rather than user referral.\n“ChatGPT’s ‘main answer’ is a visibility engine, not a traffic engine.”\nThe comments and reactions on LinkedIn threads analyzing this data were strikingly consistent and insightful. Users don’t click because ChatGPT solves their problem for them. Unlike Google, where the answer is a link, ChatGPT provides the answer directly.\n“Traffic stopped being the metric to optimize for. We’re now optimizing for trust transfer.”\n“If ChatGPT cites my brand as the authority, I’ve already won the user’s trust before they even visit my site. The click is just a formality.”\nThis represents a fundamental shift in how humans consume information. In the pre-AI era, the pattern was: “I need to find the answer” → click → read → evaluate → decide. In the AI era, however, it has become: “I need an answer” → “receive” → “trust” → “act”, with no click required. AI becomes the trusted intermediary. The source becomes the silent authority.\nThis marks the beginning of what some are calling “Inception SEO”: optimizing for the answer itself, rather than for click-throughs. The goal is no longer to be findable. The goal is to be the source that the AI trusts and quotes.\nTraditional SEO relies on indexation and keyword matching. LLMs, however, operate on entirely different principles. They rely on internal model knowledge wherever possible, drawing on trained data acquired through crawls, licensed content, and partnerships. They only fetch external data when the model determines that its internal knowledge is insufficient, outdated, or unverified.\nWhen selecting sources, LLMs prioritize domain authority and trust signals, content clarity and structure, entity recognition and knowledge graph alignment, historical accuracy and factual consistency, and recency for time-sensitive queries. They then decide whether to cite at all based on query type and confidence level.\n“You’re no longer competing in an index. You’re competing in the model’s confidence graph.”\nThis has radical implications. The old SEO logic was “Rank for 1,000 keywords → Get traffic from 1,000 search queries.” The new AI logic is “Become the authoritative entity for 10 topics → Become the default source for 10,000 AI-generated answers.”\nIn this new landscape, a single, highly authoritative domain has the potential to dominate AI citations across an entire topic cluster. “Long-tail SEO” may become less relevant as AI synthesizes answers rather than matching specific keywords. Topic authority becomes more valuable than keyword authority. Being cited once by ChatGPT can influence millions of downstream answers.\nAs CTR is declining, brands must embrace metrics that reflect AI-native visibility. The first of these is “share of model presence,” which is how often your brand, entity, or URLs appear in AI-generated answers, regardless of whether they are clicked on or not. This is analogous to “share of voice” in traditional advertising, but instead of measuring presence in paid media, it measures presence in the AI’s reasoning process.\nLLMs are increasingly producing authoritative statements, such as “According to Publisher X…,” “Experts at Brand Y recommend…,” and “As noted by Industry Leader Z…”\nThis is the new “brand recall,” except it happens at machine speed and on a massive scale, influencing millions of users without them ever visiting your website. Being directly recommended by an AI is more powerful than ranking No. 1 on Google, as the AI’s endorsement carries algorithmic authority. Users don’t see competing sources; the recommendation is contextualized within their specific query, and it occurs at the exact moment of decision-making.\nThen, there’s contextual presence: being part of the reasoning chain even when not explicitly cited. This is the “dark matter” of AI visibility. Your content may inform the AI’s answer without being directly attributed, yet still shape how millions of users understand a topic. When a user asks about the best practices for managing a remote team, for example, the AI might synthesize insights from 50 sources, but only cite three of them explicitly. However, the other 47 sources still influenced the reasoning process. Your authority on this topic has now shaped the answer that millions of users will see.\nHigh-intent queries are another crucial metric. Narrow, bottom-of-funnel prompts still convert, showing a click-through rate (CTR) of between 2.6% and 4%. Such queries usually involve product comparisons, specific instructions requiring visual aids, recent news or events, technical or regulatory specifications requiring primary sources, or academic research requiring citation verification. The strategic implication is clear: Don’t abandon click optimization entirely. Instead, identify the 10-20% of queries where clicks still matter and optimize aggressively for those.\nFinally, LLMs judge authority based on what might be called “surrounding ecosystem presence” and cross-platform consistency. This means internal consistency across all your pages; schema and structured data that machines can easily parse; knowledge graph alignment through presence in Wikidata, Wikipedia, and industry databases; cross-domain entity coherence, where authoritative third parties reference you consistently; and temporal consistency, where your authority persists over time.\nThis holistic entity SEO approach optimizes your entire digital presence as a coherent, trustworthy entity, not individual pages. Traditional SEO metrics cannot capture this shift. Publishers will require new dashboards to track AI citations and mentions, new tools to measure “model share” across LLM platforms, new attribution methodologies in a post-click world, and new frameworks to measure influence without direct traffic.\nMany SEOs immediately saw the same thing in the dataset:\n“This looks like the early blueprint for an OpenAI Search Console.”\nGoogle had “Not Provided,” hiding keyword data. AI platforms may give us “Not Even Observable,” hiding the entire decision-making process. This creates several problems. For publishers, it’s impossible to optimize what you can’t measure; there’s no accountability for AI platforms, and asymmetric information advantages emerge. For the ecosystem, it reduces innovation in content strategy, concentrates power in AI platform providers, and makes it harder to identify and correct AI bias or errors.\nBased on this leaked dataset and industry needs, an ideal “AI Search Console” would provide core metrics like impression volume by URL, entity, and topic, surface-level breakdowns, click-through rates, and engagement metrics, conversation-level analytics showing unique sessions, and time-series data showing trends. It would show attribution and sourcing details: how often you’re explicitly cited versus implicitly used, which competitors appear alongside you, query categories where you’re most visible, and confidence scores indicating how much the AI trusts your content.\nDiagnostic tools would explain why specific URLs were selected or rejected, what content quality signals the AI detected, your entity recognition status, knowledge graph connectivity, and structured data validation. Optimization recommendations would identify gaps in your entity footprint, content areas where authority is weak, opportunities to improve AI visibility, and competitive intelligence.\nOpenAI and other AI platforms will eventually need to provide this data for several reasons. Regulatory pressure from the EU AI Act and similar regulations may require algorithmic transparency. Media partnerships will demand visibility metrics as part of licensing deals. Economic sustainability requires feedback loops for a healthy content ecosystem. And competitive advantage means the first platform to offer comprehensive analytics will attract publisher partnerships.\nThe dataset we’re analyzing may represent the prototype for what will eventually become standard infrastructure.\nThe comments raised significant concerns and opportunities for the media sector. The contrast between Google’s and OpenAI’s economic models is stark. Google contributes to media financing through neighbouring rights payments in the EU and other jurisdictions. It still sends meaningful traffic, albeit declining, and has established economic relationships with publishers. Google also participates in advertising ecosystems that fund content creation.\nBy contrast, OpenAI and similar AI platforms currently only pay select media partners under private agreements, send almost no traffic with a CTR of less than 1%, extract maximum value from content while providing minimal compensation, and create no advertising ecosystem for publishers.\nAI Overviews already reduce organic CTR . ChatGPT takes this trend to its logical conclusion by eliminating almost all traffic. This will force a complete restructuring of business models and raise urgent questions: Should AI platforms pay neighbouring rights like search engines do? Will governments impose compensatory frameworks for content use? Will publishers negotiate direct partnerships with LLM providers? Will new licensing ecosystems emerge for training data, inference, and citation? How should content that is viewed but not clicked on be valued?\nSeveral potential economic models are emerging. One model is citation-based compensation, where platforms pay based on how often content is cited or used. This is similar to music streaming royalties, though transparent metrics are required.\nUnder licensing agreements, publishers would license content directly to AI platforms, with tiered pricing based on authority and freshness. This is already happening with major outlets such as the Associated Press, Axel Springer, and the Financial Times. Hybrid attribution models would combine citation frequency, impressions, and click-throughs, weighted by query value and user intent, in order to create standardized compensation frameworks.\nRegulatory mandates could see governments requiring AI platforms to share revenue with content creators, based on precedents in neighbouring rights law. This could potentially include mandatory arbitration mechanisms.\nThis would be the biggest shift in digital media economics since Google Ads. Platforms that solve this problem fairly will build sustainable ecosystems. Those that do not will face regulatory intervention and publisher revolts.\nBased on the data and expert reactions, an emerging playbook is taking shape. Firstly, publishers must prioritize inclusion over clicks. The real goal is to be part of the solution, not to generate a spike in traffic. This involves creating comprehensive, authoritative content that AI can synthesize, prioritizing clarity and factual accuracy over tricks to boost engagement, structuring content so that key facts can be easily extracted, and establishing topic authority rather than chasing individual keywords.\nStrengthening your entity footprint is equally critical. Every brand, author, product, and concept must be machine-readable and consistent. Publishers should ensure their entity exists on Wikidata and Wikipedia, maintain consistent NAP (name, address, phone number) details across all properties, implement comprehensive schema markup, create and maintain knowledge graph entries, build structured product catalogues, and establish clear entity relationships, linking companies to people, products, and topics.\nBuilding trust signals for retrieval is important because LLMs prioritize high-authority, clearly structured, low-ambiguity content. These trust signals include:\nPublishers should not abandon click optimization entirely. Instead, they should target bottom-funnel prompts that still demonstrate a measurable click-through rate (CTR) of between 2% and 4%, since AI responses are insufficient.\nStrategy: Identify the 10–20% of your topic space where AI cannot fully satisfy user intent, and optimize those pages for clicks.\nIn terms of content, it is important to lead with the most important information, use clear and definitive language, cite primary sources, avoid ambiguity and hedging unless accuracy requires it, and create content that remains accurate over long timeframes.\nPerhaps the most important shift is mental: Stop thinking in terms of traffic and start thinking in terms of influence. Value has shifted from visits to the reasoning process itself. New success metrics should track how often you are cited by AI, the percentage of AI responses in your field that mention you, how your “share of model” compares with that of your competitors, whether you are building cumulative authority that persists across model updates, and whether AI recognizes you as the definitive source for your core topics.\nThe strategic focus shifts from “drive 1 million monthly visitors” to “influence 10 million AI-mediated decisions.”\nPublishers must also diversify their revenue streams so that they are not dependent on traffic-based monetization. Alternative models include building direct relationships with audiences through email lists, newsletters, and memberships; offering premium content via paywalls, subscriptions, and exclusive access; integrating commerce through affiliate programmes, product sales, and services; forming B2B partnerships to offer white-label content, API access, and data licensing; and negotiating deals with AI platforms for direct compensation for content use.\nPublishers that control the relationship with their audience rather than depending on intermediary platforms will thrive.\nA fundamental truth about artificial intelligence is often overlooked: these systems do not generate content independently; they rely entirely on the accumulated work of millions of human creators, including journalism, research, technical documentation, and creative writing, which form the foundation upon which every model is built. This dependency is the reason why OpenAI has been pursuing licensing deals with major publishers so aggressively. It is not an act of corporate philanthropy, but an existential necessity. A language model that is only trained on historical data becomes increasingly disconnected from the current reality with each passing day. It is unable to detect breaking news or update its understanding through pure inference. It is also unable to invent ground truth from computational power alone.\nThis creates what I call the “super-predator paradox”: If OpenAI succeeds in completely disrupting traditional web traffic, causing publishers to collapse and the flow of new, high-quality content to slow to a trickle, the model’s training data will become increasingly stale. Its understanding of current events will degrade, and users will begin to notice that the responses feel outdated and disconnected from reality. In effect, the super-predator will have devoured its ecosystem and will now find itself starving in a content desert of its own creation.\nThe paradox is inescapable and suggests two very different possible futures. In one, OpenAI continues to treat publishers as obstacles rather than partners. This would lead to the collapse of the content ecosystem and the AI systems that depend on it. In the other, OpenAI shares value with publishers through sustainable compensation models, attribution systems, and partnerships. This would ensure that creators can continue their work. The difference between these futures is not primarily technological; the tools to build sustainable, creator-compensating AI systems largely exist today. Rather, it is a matter of strategic vision and willingness to recognize that, if artificial intelligence is to become the universal interface for human knowledge, it must sustain the world from which it learns rather than cannibalize it for short-term gain. The next decade will be defined not by who builds the most powerful model, but by who builds the most sustainable one by who solves the super-predator paradox before it becomes an extinction event for both the content ecosystem and the AI systems that cannot survive without it.\nNote: All data and stats cited above are from the Open AI partner report, unless otherwise indicated."

    "title": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai Says Information Ecosystem Is Richer Than AI via @sejournal, @martinibuster",
    "date": "2025-12-08T11:17:37+00:00",
    "content": "In a recent interview with the BBC, Sundar Pichai emphasized that AI is not a standalone source of information. He affirmed that AI works together with search and that AI and Search have their uses. Pichai also said that AI is not a replacement for either search, the information ecosystem, or actual subject matter experts.\nA number of tweets and articles mischaracterized Pichai’s remarks, including a BBC News social media post summarizing the interview with the line, “Don’t blindly trust what AI tells you.”\nThat phrasing misleadingly suggests that Pichai said don’t trust AI. But that’s not what Pichai meant. His full answer emphasized that AI is not a standalone source of information, that the information ecosystem is greater than that.\nSundar Pichai had just finished describing how AI will, in a few years time, usher in new opportunities and create new kinds of jobs based on what humans can do with AI. He used the example of envisioning a feature-length movie.\nIn response to that statement, the interviewer challenged Pichai with a question about the fallibility of AI, saying that what Pichai described is built on the assumption that AI works.\nPichai’s statement was broadly about how people will use AI in a few years time. The interviewer’s question was narrowly focused on the accuracy and truth of AI. The conversation between the interviewer and Pichai contained this dynamic, where the interviewer kept narrowing the focus to AI in isolation and Pichai kept broadening the focus to the wider information ecosystem within which AI exists.\nThe interviewer keeps pressing Pichai with variations of the same narrow question:\nPichai repeatedly answers by placing AI within a wider context:\nThe interviewer kept zooming in to look at the AI “ tree, ” and Pichai responded by zooming out to explain AI within the context of the information ecosystem “ forest .” This is the key to understanding what Pichai means by his answers.\nIn response to Pichai’s statements of how AI will transform society in the coming years, the interviewer asked about the truthfulness of AI today:\n“So all of the hopes, the hype, the valuations, the social benefit of this transformation you’ve just described, you’ve built on a central assumption that the technology functions, that it works.\nLet me propose one simple test of Gemini, which is your booming ChatGPT kind of competitor. Is it accurate always? Does it tell the truth?”\nPichai explained that generative AI is not a source of truth, it’s simply making a statistical prediction of how to respond. In that context he said that Google Search is what grounds AI in facts and truth. Grounding is a system for anchoring generative AI with real-world facts instead of relying on its training data.\n“Look, we are working hard from a scientific standpoint to ground it in real world information. And there are areas, part of what we’ve done with Gemini is we’ve brought the power of Google Search. So it uses Google Search as a tool to try and answer, to give answers more accurately. But there are moments, these AI models fundamentally have a technology by which they’re predicting what’s next, and they are prone to errors.”\nThe next part of Pichai’s answer underlines the fact that AI and Search are tools that people use for different purposes. The point he is making is that AI is not a standalone technology that has replaced Search. He said to use each tool for “what they’re good at.”\n“Today, I think, we take pride in the amount of work we put in to give as accurate information as possible. But the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.\nThis is why people also use Google Search, and we have other products which are more grounded in providing accurate information, right? But the same tools are helpful if you want to creatively write something.\nSo you have to learn to use these tools for what they’re good at and not blindly trust everything they say.”\nThe interviewer echoed Pichai’s statement about not blindly trusting then challenged him again about reliability.\nBut let me suggest to you that you have a special responsibility because this whole model, type of model, transformer model, the T in ChatGPT, was invented here under you. And you know that it’s a probability. And I just wonder if you accept the end result of all this fantastic investment is the information is less reliable?”\nPichai returned to his first answer, that AI is not all that there is, that AI is just one source of information from a great many sources, including from actual human experts. The interviewer was trying to pin Pichai down to talking about generative AI and Pichai was answering by saying that it’s not just AI.\n“I think if you only construct systems standalone, and you only rely on that, that would be true.\nWhich is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem… has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\n…Truth matters. Journalism matters. All of the surrounding things we have today matters, right?\nSo if you’re a student, you’re talking to your teacher.\nIf as a consumer, you’re going to a doctor, you want to trust your doctor.\nPichai’s point is that AI exists within a larger world tools, human knowledge and expertise, not as a replacement for it. His emphasis on teachers, doctors, and journalism shows that human expertise remains a high standard for truth and accuracy. Pichai declined to answer questions in a way that treated AI as the sole system for answers. Instead, he kept emphasizing that AI is only one part of where we get information.\nThis is why Pichai’s answer cannot be reduced to a click-baity line like “Don’t blindly trust what AI tells you, says Google’s Sundar Pichai.” The deeper message is about how he, and by extension, Google, views AI as one tool out of many."

    "date": "2025-12-08T10:05:47+00:00",
    "content": "Limiter le churn grâce aux signaux comportementaux ?\nPour les entreprises qui proposent des services en ligne, comme les SaaS, attirer des utilisateurs n’a en réalité jamais été un véritable défi.\nEn effet, c’est davantage leur activation, leur retour régulier sur une plateforme et leur engagement qui conditionnent la croissance de votre service…\nAvec de plus en plus de services en ligne, les professionnels n’ont pas d’autre choix que de se démarquer s’ils espèrent gagner du terrain face à leurs concurrents, et attirer des utilisateurs pleinement engagés.\nAujourd’hui, lorsqu’un utilisateur s’inscrit mais n’effectue aucune action réelle, lorsqu’un client adopte quelques fonctionnalités d’un logiciel ou d’un service en ligne sans aller plus loin, ou lorsqu’un compte actif décroît progressivement, les risques de churn augmentent . Pour toutes les entreprises concernées, comprendre ces signaux avant qu’il ne soit trop tard est désormais devenu un réel enjeu stratégique …\nFace à ce défi, l’automatisation joue ici un rôle déterminant . Elle observe, détecte, alerte et surtout agit sans délai. Quand elle est associée à un modèle progressif comme le Loop Marketing de HubSpot, elle peut aussi aider les équipes à transformer les signaux faibles en actions concrètes.\nC’est précisément ce changement de posture, qui consiste à passer d’une gestion réactive à un système apprenant , qui améliore la rétention client de manière durable. Pour cela, les solutions les plus avancées sur le marché, comme HubSpot, permettent même de créer un compte gratuit pour se faire une idée très rapidement des différentes possibilités.\nPendant longtemps, les entreprises qui évoluent en ligne se sont appuyées sur un funnel classique pour piloter leur croissance, avec l’ acquisition , puis l’ activation , la conversion , et la fidélisation . Mais dans la réalité, les parcours utilisateurs suivent rarement une ligne droite.\nEntre les nombreuses ruptures d’usage, les retours parfois aléatoires sur la plateforme, les interactions segmentées entre le marketing et le produit, tous les cycles se fragmentent. Ce décalage entraîne trois blocages qu’un modèle linéaire peine à absorber…\nPour commencer, une inscription ne garantit jamais une adoption réelle . Les chiffres du secteur le montrent : entre 40 et 60% des utilisateurs d’un SaaS deviennent dormants en moins de deux semaines.\nParmi les raisons, les spécialistes évoquent des fonctionnalités trop peu mises en avant , un onboarding peu contextualisé, un manque de clarté dans les premiers messages, ou même un produit encore abstrait lors des premières minutes.\nChaque utilisateur inactif dès le départ augmente mécaniquement la probabilité de churn dans les semaines qui suivent.\nSouvent, il arrive que les relances interviennent après plusieurs semaines d’inactivité , comme des séquences standardisées, des e-mails génériques, ou encore des analyses ponctuelles des comportements.\nMalheureusement, ce mode de fonctionnement ne permet pas au produit d’apprendre, ni à l’équipe marketing d’ajuster les campagnes en continu.\nLes logiciels et les services en ligne disposent d’un volume massif d’informations comportementales qu’elles peuvent exploiter, comme les fonctionnalités utilisées, les actions répétées, le taux d’usage, la réduction progressive d’activité, ou encore des questions posées au support client.\nNéanmoins, le problème n’est pas la donnée , mais plutôt c’est l’absence de boucle qui permet de la transformer en actions automatisées.\nFace à ce constat, pour HubSpot, le Loop Marketing se présente comme une vision « circulaire « du parcours dans l’univers du SaaS. Au lieu de considérer l’utilisateur comme un simple lead à convertir, il devient alors un acteur d’un cycle continu : ses actions nourrissent les suivantes, et les signaux qu’il produit influencent les futures interactions.\nHubSpot a d’ailleurs été l’un des premiers à intégrer cette approche directement au sein de sa plateforme, en reliant les données marketing , les données produit et l’ automatisation .\nActuellement, cette boucle repose sur cinq séquences, avec l’inscription, l’activation, l’usage, le feedback, et la rétention. À chaque étape, le système apprend… et réajuste.\nDans le cas de HubSpot, les premiers retours sont positifs, avec 83% des utilisateurs qui estiment que la plateforme leur rend service en regroupant toutes les données, et 79% qui déclarent que cette centralisation améliore la qualité de leurs leads. Cette unification permet aussi d’ alimenter le Loop Marketing avec une matière première cohérente, nécessaire pour détecter les signaux préalables au churn.\nPour mieux répondre aux attentes de ses utilisateurs, HubSpot a intégré des fonctionnalités qui entrent dans cette logique, avec notamment :\nGrâce à cette boucle active, les campagnes peuvent s’ajuster naturellement, à mesure que l’utilisateur évolue sur le produit, et sans action directe de votre part.\nPour une solution comme un SaaS, automatiser la lutte contre le churn consiste à transformer les signaux utilisateurs en actions concrètes . Là encore, HubSpot facilite cette transition grâce à un modèle simple et structuré autour de quatre étapes…\nAvant d’agir trop rapidement, vous devez d’abord clarifier quelques éléments, et comprendre qui sont les utilisateurs cibles , où se situent leurs frictions , quelles preuves et bénéfices peuvent les aider à avancer.\nDans le cas de HubSpot, avec Breeze Assistant, un ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), c’est à dire votre « client idéal « , peut être généré directement à partir des données du CRM. À partir de cette base, le Marketing Studio construit automatiquement des messages cohérents sur vos pages, vos e-mails et vos autres contenus.\nUn SaaS de gestion documentaire identifie que la promesse la plus convaincante repose sur la centralisation rapide de fichiers. HubSpot décline cette valeur dans tous les points de contact.\nNous savons que chaque utilisateur ne suit pas la même progression , et l’automatisation permet d’ajuster les relances selon les signaux observés.\nSi, parmi les signaux les plus communs, on peut mentionner l’ inactivité d’un utilisateur , l’ utilisation d’une fonctionnalité bien précise, l’ absence d’une action , ou la consultation de pages de tarifs , il est possible d’y associer d’autres signaux encore plus précis.\nDans HubSpot, afin de limiter le churn au maximum, cela se traduit par un onboarding dynamique, des e-mails déclenchés par des actions bien identifiées, et plus récemment, par des segments IA orientés selon le comportement.\nUn utilisateur crée un compte mais n’importe aucun fichier. HubSpot déclenche un e-mail explicatif très clair, un message dans l’application, et une relance personnalisée au bout de 24 heures.\nDésormais, les utilisateurs naviguent sur plusieurs canaux, et pour limiter le churn, le Loop Marketing vise à maintenir un dialogue permanent avec ceux-ci sans multiplier les outils.\nDepuis l’interface de HubSpot, il est possible de gérer des campagnes publicitaires basées sur l’intention, des séquences d’e-mails sur plusieurs étapes, des messages au sein d’une application mobile, et même une assistance par IA disponible 24h/24 et 7j/7.\nUn utilisateur consulte la page « Tarifs » après plusieurs actions. HubSpot déclenche alors une campagne publicitaire ainsi qu’un message dans l’application mobile pour proposer une fonctionnalité premium.\nLa réduction du churn passe systématiquement par une analyse et une adaptation continue. Dans HubSpot, grâce à l’automatisation, le système repère les signaux précurseurs du churn.\nParmi les plus courants, HubSpot peut détecter la baisse d’utilisation de votre outil, la répétition limitée d’une fonctionnalité principale, la réduction progressive de la fréquence de connexion à votre service, et l’absence de progression dans les tâches que vous avez pu identifier.\nPour cela, les analyses de cohortes et les workflows associés dans HubSpot vous permettent d’affiner la compréhension du comportement utilisateur, sans y passer trop de temps.\nHubSpot détecte que les utilisateurs qui créent trois projets dans les 48h multiplient par quatre leurs chances de rester actifs. Cette action devient alors un élément central de l’onboarding automatisé.\nLes entreprises qui adoptent une stratégie d’automatisation pour la réduction du churn constatent d’ores et déjà des premiers résultats grâce à HubSpot. Par exemple, mc2i observe 28% de transactions supplémentaires , en grande partie grâce à une personnalisation basée sur les signaux comportementaux, mais aussi grâce à une meilleure orchestration fine des moments clés du parcours des leads.\nEt du côté des utilisateurs HubSpot, les études montrent que 95% constatent un ROI positif , 84% signalent une hausse du chiffre d’affaires , et les clients qui vont jusqu’à utiliser plusieurs hubs bénéficient même d’un taux de clôture 5 fois supérieur ."
