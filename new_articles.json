    "content": "Creating a social media campaign is an intricate process that requires a deep understanding of your audience, brand, products and competitors. From start to finish, it’s imperative to stay focused on your brand’s goals and your audience’s needs.\nAnd the campaign doesn’t end when your team hits “publish.” Tracking, monitoring, listening and analyzing campaign results is crucial to refining your social media marketing strategy and proving the far-reaching impacts your team has on company goals.\nIn this guide, we’re sharing the essential steps to running a social media campaign , four (and a few bonus) of our favorite recent campaigns and 20 tips for building your own unforgettable campaign.\nBefore you dive in, download our social media campaign brief template to start your campaign efforts strong.\nA social media campaign is a coordinated set of marketing actions across one or multiple social media platforms, executed over a specific timeframe to achieve measurable business objectives.\nThey’re usually part of an omnichannel strategy . Components of a social media campaign include:\nBefore you start planning, you need to determine what type of campaign best suits your goals. While every campaign is unique, most fall into a few distinct categories.\nThese campaigns build anticipation and excitement for a new product or feature release. They typically involve a teaser phase, a launch day push and sustained post-launch promotion to drive sales and adoption.\nBrand awareness campaigns focus on introducing your brand to new audiences or reinforcing your values to existing followers. The primary goal is to increase visibility and share of voice rather than driving immediate conversions.\nContests incentivize engagement and follower growth by offering prizes in exchange for participation. These campaigns are highly effective for quickly expanding your reach and generating user-generated content.\nThese time-sensitive campaigns capitalize on cultural moments, holidays or seasons to connect with audiences. They leverage the existing buzz around specific dates to drive relevance and sales.\nUGC campaigns encourage your community to create content featuring your brand or products. This strategy builds social proof and provides you with a library of authentic content to repurpose across your channels.\nBefore you can get creative with your campaign, you need to do your research. And this starts by putting an ear to the digital ground and listening—to both your audience and competitors alike.\nTo design the strongest campaigns, start by listening to what your audience is saying on social.\nUsing an AI-powered social listening tool like Sprout to analyze conversations across social media platforms allows you to:\nUnderstand your target audience: Analyze conversations about your brand and competitors\nCompetitive positioning: Identify gaps and opportunities in your market\nPerformance insights: Measure sentiment and reception of past campaigns\nWhen you don’t listen to your audiences and build campaigns around what they care about, you risk pushing out content that isn’t quite right.\nSocial listening enables you to analyze your target audiences’ conversations about your brand, product, competitors and existing campaigns. And that makes it possible to extract the topics that matter to your target audience and develop campaigns and messaging that resonate.\nA competitive analysis can also help you understand where you fall among your competitors—where they fall short and where you outpace them. Knowing your competitive position can help you set goals for your campaign.\nFor example, use social listening during a competitive analysis to understand metrics like share of voice. This shows you how you stand out from the competition and how you need to tailor your campaign to improve your SOV.\nAI-powered social listening tools allow you to go beyond measuring performance metrics to understand how audiences feel about your campaigns.\nUnderstanding how past campaigns were received is helpful when crafting new ones. But it can also be helpful in the moment if you need to adjust a campaign that isn’t getting the right reception.\nTo run your high-impact social media campaign from start to finish, use this three-step process.\nGenerate social media campaign ideas by asking your team (and teams outside of social) these questions:\nWhat do we want to accomplish with a social media campaign?\nDuring the ideation stage of your social media campaign, it’s imperative to consult with teams from other business functions to ensure you have a complete understanding of your customers, your products and your competitive landscape. The insights you glean from other teams can inform and bolster a campaign to make it even more audience-driven.\nIn fact, The Sprout Social Index™ revealed that 65% of marketers agree other departments inform their social efforts.\nThe success of campaigns like Nike’s #MambaDay tribute shows how powerful a well-executed, emotionally resonant idea is.\nAfter defining your campaign’s purpose, focus on content creation. These proven strategies drive memorable social campaigns:\nInfluencers and creators are already masters of creating content that resonates. They’ve built their followings based on engaging content they share on social. With their expertise, they can produce unique content for your brand that strikes a chord with their community.\nMost importantly, influencers bring a key element to your campaign: authenticity, which, according to the Index, is the number one thing consumers don’t see enough of from brands on social.\nNot every piece of content you produce needs to align with all members of your target audience across the sales funnel. Instead, shift your focus to create content specific to where your campaign audience is in their buying journey.\nFor example, in the awareness stage, your goal is to increase the number of people who know about your brand, services and offerings. The content you produce within this stage needs to be eye-catching, but doesn’t necessarily have to speak directly to what your brand has to offer.\nThe focus here is to grab your audience’s attention. “ Edutainment ” content—social posts that entertain and educate—is perfect for this journey stage. Think infographics and how-to videos.\nThe most memorable brands on social have the best products and services, according to the Index.\nBy reposting user-generated content (UGC), you fulfill your audience’s expectations while saving your team time and creative resources. And your brand advocates are delighted to be featured by your brand and have a chance to grow their following.\nShort-form video continues to drive the highest engagement rates across all major social platforms, making it essential for campaign success.\nRemember that your audience’s preferences might differ slightly from the general population, so it’s important to factor in your most successful content types and themes using your organization’s own benchmark or historical data.\nIf you’re running out of content ideas to fuel your social campaigns, turn to your competitors for inspiration. Your brand and your competitors may be targeting similar ideal customer personas, so zero in on where their social efforts are winning share of voice.\nWhat are they doing that works? Where are they missing the mark?\nBe careful not to mimic your competitors’ content, but instead use their social strategies as a catalyst for your creative ideas.\nChoosing the right social media metrics to track and analyze is vital to properly gauge the success of your social media campaigns and how well your campaign translates to reaching business goals.\nFor a complete deep-dive, check out this video that walks you through the 17 most important social media metrics .\nWhen it comes to tracking campaigns, engagement metrics—such as the number of unique people who have clicked, liked, commented on or shared your posts—typically provide the most compelling data to determine your campaign’s overall effectiveness.\nOnce you determine the metrics that matter most to your campaign, start measuring your success and reporting on your social media analytics . Measuring performance throughout your campaign enables you to make adjustments to your social media strategy and content using real-time audience insights.\nTo keep your campaign organized—from ideation to content creation to making sense of your metrics—use a social media management platform like Sprout Social. With Sprout’s Campaigns, create everything you need to run a successful campaign in one place, including briefs, creative assets and analytics reports.\nTwo of the most important parts of a social media campaign are setting the appropriate social media goals and measuring performance. This is crucial if you want to create stronger campaigns in the future, quantify ROI and business results and report to stakeholders.\nHere are a few tips that will help you set KPIs and benchmarks for your social media marketing campaigns.\nKnowing the key outcomes that matter most to you will help identify and inform your KPIs. If your goal is awareness, then impressions, reach, share of voice and video views will be key for you.\nIf your goal is to drive sales and website traffic, then leads, clicks, trials, downloads, conversions and website traffic will be key. And many of these are easy to track in Google Analytics by using UTMs .\nIf your goal is a better brand perception, tracking sentiment will be crucial.\nPro tip: There are three engagement metrics that are universal among the major social networks:\nClicks: Users are only going to click on content that interests them. If you experience high clickthrough rates, your content is intriguing enough for users to want to see more, meaning that your content is effective.\nLikes: If your content resonates with an audience and is receiving a high number of likes, it will naturally gain popularity (and hopefully collect more clicks).\nShares: Clicks and likes are good indicators of audience interest. However, when users like your content enough to share it, you’ve achieved the holy grail of relevancy and will increase your visibility.\nOnce you know the “why,” the next step is to put a number to your goals. And one of the most effective ways to do this is by benchmarking against your industry, competitors and yourself.\nFirst, see how your brand stacks up against the competition—what’s your share of voice? And how is your content performing compared to theirs?\nUsing a tool like Sprout Social’s competitive analysis listening tool automates this process through real-time share of voice tracking, sentiment analysis and engagement benchmarking across all major social platforms. Sprout Social’s integrated dashboard eliminates manual calculations and provides actionable insights within minutes.\nYou also measure campaign performance against industry benchmarks, like those found in Sprout Social’s 2025 Content Benchmarks Report . And don’t forget to benchmark against yourself, as well.\nWhere is your share of voice and brand sentiment now? And what are your current performance metrics like? Pair where you’re at with your campaign’s purpose to understand what goals you need to achieve, and where you want to see that impact.\nSMART goals are a framework to use when setting goals for your campaign, and social media channels overall. They are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive.\nEnsure the goals you set for your campaign follow this framework to ease the process of setting goals, and to better track success.\nDon’t keep your campaign results to yourself—share them with your team and relevant stakeholders outside of it, from senior leaders to customer care teams.\nReporting on your campaign will help you refine how you set goals in the future, and refine future campaigns. It will also give you the chance to celebrate and communicate the success and learnings of your current campaign.\nFrom different social media platforms to influencer content and paid vs. organic posts, there’s a lot to measure across campaigns. A tool like Sprout Social enables you to report on your campaign across channels, posts and types of content in one place with a robust suite of analytics and reporting tools .\nSome of the best social media campaigns have joined the ranks of the greatest creative efforts in advertising history.\nTo help you get inspired, here are some attention-grabbing creative social media campaign examples to get your creative gears turning.\nLEGO never fails to create fun content. And recently, they leaned into their slogan “adults welcome” with a social campaign built to bring attention to new additions in their Botanicals Collection—a range of flower-building sets.\nLEGO chose the perfect time to promote these new flowery sets—in the lead-up to Valentine’s Day. Their social campaign consisted of a few pieces (no pun intended). On TikTok, they featured a weekly LEGO Botanicals Challenge where florist creators were challenged to make creative displays using Botanicals sets.\nBryce is bringing the outside in this week on the LEGO Botanicals Challenge​. ​ Watch the whole thing: @FLOWER BOY ​ #flowertok #flowersareforever #legobotanical #lego\nOn Instagram, they posted videos of a former contestant on The Bachelor building beautiful Valentine’s-themed displays and LEGO Botanicals.\nWhat do you call a florist who builds LEGO flowers? Le Florist 🤌 #LEGO #LEGOFlowers #LEGOBotanicals\nThe takeaway: We don’t all have the budget to hire a former Bachelor star. But the takeaway from LEGO’s campaign is less about the flashiness and more about the creativity.\nTheir team gave LEGO Botanicals practical, fun applications that were all about connections, celebration and the Valentine’s Day holiday.\nThink about how you can involve customers and creators in a fun way, like the Botanicals Challenge—and how you can connect your campaign to people on an emotional level.\nWe just couldn’t choose between these two campaigns.\nMost recently, McDonald’s started flipping the classic golden arches into a less-classic golden “W.”\nMcDonald’s has been temporarily calling itself “WcDonald’s” in honor of how the massive chain is often portrayed in many manga, TV show, graphic novels and video games. On the digital front, they’ve changed their social channels to reflect this new approach.\nAnd their social content is filled with manga-inspired art and WcDonald’s shorts inspired by the medium.\nIt’s no question that McDonald’s knows how to have fun on social. And that was also apparent when their character took over posting on their social accounts to promote the Grimace Shake, giving the character a unique voice.\nSocial listening is how you do the same—use it to understand how people reference your brand and if there are any trends to join.\nAnd the Grimace takeover is a great example of how your brand can have some fun on social. Do you have any characters you can hand the mic to? And if not, what creator or even employee takeovers make sense to lean into?\nThese two campaigns aren’t new, but they’re impactful and have staying power.\nYou’ve no doubt seen Apple’s #ShotOniPhone before—and you’ve likely even used it: to date, there are 29.6 million posts using the hashtag on Instagram alone.\nAnd that content and hashtag have been repurposed into countless billboards, commercials and ads for the brand, taking social offline.\nSimilarly, #YourShotPhotographer by National Geographic is a hashtag that unites Nat Geo’s photo community. They’ve also turned to Instagram to create a space for their Nat Geo Your Shot community and amassed a following of 6.6 million.\nThe takeaway: Both of these campaigns are ongoing, and are a stellar example of how you can source UGC and inspiration directly from your community—celebrating your diverse and loyal audience in the process. Your community can fuel campaign concepts and content and bring your brand to life in a new way.\nFor your next campaign, think about how you can create a hashtag to gather UGC, drum up excitement and even create community amongst your audience.\nWe love when a brand gets cinematic. The brand’s 2023 “Originals” campaign celebrates the sports celebrities and everyday people alike who embody the brand.\nAs a core part of this campaign, Adidas created several short films shared across their social media platforms, each named after one of their iconic shoes: Gazelle, Superstar and Samba.\nThey shared these films on their YouTube channel and leveraged Instagram to show previews of each film in Reels, connecting their content with the hashtags #WeGaveTheWorldAnOriginal and #AdidasOriginals.\nThe takeaway: We’re not saying you need to create high-production films or hire celebrities for your next campaign. But we are saying that you should tap into the storytelling angle behind your brand and product. Adidas did this beautifully, highlighting and honoring their audience, history and product in this campaign.\nLike these examples, many of the most successful social media campaigns span multiple networks simultaneously—with most translating to channels outside of social. But if you’re looking to create a network-specific campaign or tailor your campaign to different network specifications, here are some helpful resources.\nSuccessful social media campaigns share these core characteristics:\nResearch-driven: Customer insights and competitive analysis guide strategy\nCross-functional: Multiple departments contribute ideas and expertise\nSustained effort: Consistent messaging over adequate timeframes\nTechnology-enabled: Social media management platforms optimize execution\nPerformance-focused: Clear KPIs and ongoing optimization\nGather insights to learn what customers think about your products and industry at large. Then you can create tailored social media campaign strategies that address specific challenges.\nHow to do this: Partner with your sales and success teams to learn about your customers. Whether you join a call, send out a survey or consult with your internal team, stress how customer intel supports creating better campaigns (and more sales).\nSome of the best creative ideas you’ll find for social media campaigns come from outside the marketing department. Remember to consult internal teams like sales, R&D, product development and HR when crafting your campaigns.\nHow to do this: Regularly convene with teams outside of social media to boost your strategy and further your impact. Consider hosting a “social media council” for key stakeholders to bring ideas to the table.\nBeing able to pivot quickly according to data findings is important. But abandoning a campaign messaging angle or visual approach within the first week or month doesn’t give your content enough time to saturate the market.\nBy pivoting too quickly, you risk diluting your brand story and recognition with too many different messages. This confuses your audience and ultimately gives your competitors an advantage.\nHow to do this: We recommend making campaigns at least three months long, and breaking your campaign plan into multiple phases. At the end of each, formally evaluate the data and come up with actionable steps to modify your plan if needed.\nBy using Sprout Social’s analytics tools, you can efficiently provide regular reporting updates to your team.\nMusic (and trending sounds ) can be a source of inspiration for your social media campaign. In some cases, you can even build campaigns around the perfect song. For others, content made with trending sounds makes for a timely complement to an ongoing campaign.\nHow to do this: Use resources like the TikTok Creative Center to stay in the know and browse sounds currently trending in your country.\nLike many of our favorite social media campaign examples demonstrated, the most effective campaigns have an omnichannel component. Where else would your audience want to interact with your content or your product?\nHow to do this: Consult with teams in charge of event planning, advertising and product design during your campaign brainstorm to make a business-wide impact.\nEven if your audience is made up of digital natives, there are no replacements for the in-person experience.\nHow to do this: Whether you have a brick-and-mortar location, pop-up shop or you’re sponsoring a booth at a conference, make an aspect of your campaign face-to-face wherever possible.\nThinking back to the LEGO example above, use real-life experiences as a chance to fuel your campaign content pipeline.\nHow to do this: Capture content of people interacting with your products, team members and spaces. You could even create a meet the team series , if it fits the goals of your campaign.\nStay zeroed-in on your conversion strategy to fill the gaps between building brand awareness and driving purchasing decisions. Design campaigns built to have a tangible impact on your bottom line by optimizing your content and distribution strategy for conversion.\nHow to do this: Fortify your campaign content with strong call to action phrases and measure conversions. Adding UTMs to links makes measuring clicks, conversions and website traffic in Google Analytics easier. And monitor your performance metrics—especially for paid content.\nHear us out—we’re not saying you should design your entire campaign using AI copy unchecked (see: the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience ). But AI and automation make your workflows and ideation processes more efficient. Use these tools to speed up your campaigns from start to finish.\nHow to do this: Before your campaign launches, use AI-powered social listening to better understand your audience. During, use AI to help you generate customer care responses to your campaign content faster, and to measure ongoing sentiment. And after, measure your campaign’s success and how people felt about it with social listening and analytics automation.\nInvesting in a tool that does it all ensures you get the most bang for your buck.

Internal influencers and employee brand advocacy efforts can supercharge your campaign.\nAn influencer management platform like Sprout Social Influencer Marketing (formerly Tagger) makes finding influencers and managing your partnerships easier— learn more about Sprout Social Influencer Marketing .\nThis may seem like putting the cart before the horse. But if you don’t have a robust customer care and engagement strategy during your campaign, you may be missing out on connection opportunities and the chance to convert an audience member into a customer.\nAccording to the 2025 Sprout Social Index™ , 73% of social media users expect brands to respond on social within 24 hours. Ensure you prioritize this as you launch your campaign.\nHow to do this: If you work with a customer support team alongside your social team, get them up to speed on the campaign—especially if it may result in an influx of messages.\nIf you’re struggling to design high-impact campaigns, take a marketer you know and admire out to lunch, or approach them on social and ask for a quick chat. Come prepared with a set of questions and be as specific as possible. We recommend choosing the marketer(s) behind a particular campaign you were impressed by, and digging deep to find out what you can learn for your brand.\nAnd research how top brands and marketing executives (including yours) operate. Stay alert to top campaigns (like the ones shared earlier in this article) and read interviews with CMO’s from best-in-class brands.\nHow to do this: We have some social media experts on our staff who are always happy to talk about how Sprout Social’s full suite of social media tools can help you leverage data to come up with new campaign ideas. And subscribe to blogs and newsletters that feature interviews and advice from leading execs .\nThink about brands that would make good partners during your next social media campaign.\nHow to do this: Build out a co-marketing strategy to expand your awareness with your target audience.\nRetention and acquisition should be two different tracks in your social media marketing campaigns.\nOn one hand, you’re trying to keep and engage with the customers you already have. On the other hand, you want to acquire more customers.\nSome content might appeal to both customers and prospective customers, but you should also create unique content to target each of these segments.\nHow to do this: In your content calendar , make sure you have posts and mini-campaigns devoted to each of these categories. Use a tool like Sprout Social’s internal tagging feature to group and categorize your social media posts based on retention and acquisition objectives. That way you can strike the right balance, while keeping an eye on performance.\nAs a social media marketer, you need to understand the unique digital customer journey your followers are taking through the marketing funnel.

Shorter campaigns lack traction while longer ones risk audience fatigue.\nWhat's the difference between organic and paid social media campaigns?\nOrganic campaigns rely on free content distribution to your existing followers and their networks, focusing on community building and long-term engagement. Paid campaigns use advertising budget to target specific demographics outside your current following, accelerating reach and driving immediate conversions.\nYou should prioritize the platforms where your target audience is most active. For B2B campaigns, LinkedIn is often the primary driver, while B2C brands targeting younger demographics find TikTok and Instagram essential.\nHow much budget do I need for a social media campaign?\nCampaign budgets vary significantly based on your goals, duration and resources. You need to account for content production costs, social media management tools, influencer partnerships and paid advertising spend.\nHow do I know if my social media campaign is working?\nYou know your campaign is working when you track performance against specific KPIs and benchmarks you set during the planning phase.
