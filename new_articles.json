You don’t, they find you,” goes the industry joke. It’s enough to think about backlinks and dozens of pitches that hit your inbox.\nHowever, most of them offer spammy links with little long-term value. Link farms, PBNs, the lot.\nThis type of saturated market makes it hard to find a reputable link building agency that can navigate the current AI-influenced search landscape.\nWe’ll share a set of steps that will help you vet link providers so you can find a reliable partner that will set you up for success in organic and AI search.\nBefore you can vet an agency, you must understand how the “AI-influenced” landscape is different. Many agencies are still stuck in the old playbook, which includes chasing guest posts, Domain Rating (DR), and raw link volume.\nA recent Ahrefs study found that 76.10% of pages cited in AI Overviews also rank in Google’s top 10 results, and 73% of participants in Editorial.Link survey believes they affect visibility in AI search.\nWhen vetting a service for AI-driven search, your criteria must shift from “How many links can you get?” to “Can you build discoverable authority that earns citations?”\nThis means looking for agencies that build your niche authority through tactics like original data studies, digital PR, and expert quotes, not just paid posts.\nThe first test is simple: do they practice what they preach?\nCheck the agency’s rankings in organic and AI search for major keywords in their sector.\nLet’s say you want to vet Editorial.Link . If you search for “best link building services,” you will find it is one of the link providers listed in the AI Overviews.\nIt doesn’t mean an agency isn’t worth your time just because it doesn’t rank high, as some services thrive on referrals and don’t focus on their own SEO.\nHowever, if they do rank, that’s a major green flag. SEO is a highly competitive niche; ranking their own website demonstrates the expertise to deliver similar results for you.\nA modern agency’s strategy should focus on earning citations.\nAsk them these questions to see whether they’ve adapted:\nPast performance is a strong indicator of future results.\nReviews on independent platforms like Clutch, Trustpilot, or G2 reveal genuine clients’ sentiment better than hand-picked testimonials on a website.\nScreenshot of Editorial.Link’s profile on Clutch, November 2025\nCase studies and customer stories offer proof of concept and provide insights into their processes, strategies, and industry fit.\nWhile case studies with named clients are ideal, some top-tier agencies are bound by client NDAs for competitive reasons. Be wary if all their examples are anonymous and vague, but don’t dismiss a vendor just for protecting client confidentiality.\nIf the clients’ names are provided, don’t take any figures at face value.\nUse an SEO tool to examine their link profiles. If you know the campaign’s timeframe, zero in on that period to see how many links they acquired, their quality, and their relevance.\nScreenshot of Thrive Internet Marketing, November 2025\nInspecting link quality is the ultimate litmus test.\nAn agency’s theoretical strategy doesn’t matter if its final product is spam. Ask for 3 – 5 examples of links they have built for recent clients.\nOnce you have the samples, don’t just look at the linking site’s DR. Audit them with this checklist:\nA reliable link-building service is fully transparent about its process and what you’re paying for.\nCan you see what you’re paying for? A reliable service will outline its process or share a list of potential prospects before starting outreach.\nAsk them for a sample report. Does it include anchor texts, website GEO, URLs, target pages, and publication dates? A vague “built 20 links” report doesn’t cut it.\nFor example, can they help you choose target pages that will benefit from a link boost most?\nOr are they just a link-placing service, as this signals a lack of expertise?\nWhen someone offers links for $100 – $200 a pop, they are typically from PBNs or bulk guest posts, and frequently disappear within months.\nValuable backlinks from trusted sites cost significantly more on average, $508.95, according to the Editorial.Link report .\nProspecting, outreach, content creation, and communication require substantial time and effort.\nThis is where unrealistic promises expose low-quality vendors.\nA reputable digital PR agency, for example, won’t guarantee the number of earned links. The final result depends on how well a story resonates with journalists.\nThe same applies to “guaranteed DR or DA.” These metrics don’t directly affect rankings, and it’s impossible to guarantee which websites will pick up a story.\nNot all link-building services have the necessary expertise to help you build visibility in the age of AI search.\nWhen choosing your link-building partner, look for a proven track record, transparency, and adaptability.\nA service with a strong search presence, demonstrable results, and a focus on AI visibility is a safer bet than one making unsubstantiated claims.\nFeatured Image: Image by Editorial.Link.
