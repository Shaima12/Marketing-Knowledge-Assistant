Both channels play very different roles, and both come with their own timelines, risks, and expectations.\nLeadership wants predictable performance. Teams want room to test. Finance wants clarity on what each dollar will return. That tension makes it easy to fall back on old splits or follow whatever trend you saw someone talk about online.\nA stronger approach starts with a clearer view of what each channel can reasonably deliver for your business today. When you understand what is realistic for your budget, your goals, and the maturity of your marketing engine, the right mix becomes much easier to define.\nThis article outlines how to think through that decision, so your SEO and PPC investments support each other rather than compete for budget.\nWhen you spend money on PPC , you’re buying immediate visibility.\nWhether it’s Google Ads , Microsoft Ads, or paid social, you’re paying for clicks, impressions, and leads right now.\nThat cost is largely predictable and better to forecast. For example, if your cost-per-click (CPC) is $3 and your budget is $10,000, you can expect about 3,300 clicks.\nPPC spend can be directly tied to pipeline , which is why it’s often favored by performance-driven teams.\nWith SEO, you’re investing in long-term growth. You’re paying for content, technical fixes, site structure improvements, and link acquisition.\nBut you don’t pay for clicks or impressions. Once rankings improve, those clicks come organically.\nThe upside is compounding growth and reduced cost per lead over time.\nThe downside? It can take months to see meaningful impact, and the cost-to-output ratio is harder to predict.\nIt’s also worth noting that PPC costs often increase with competition, while SEO costs tend to remain relatively stable over time. That can make SEO more scalable in the long term, especially for brands in high-CPC industries.\nIf you need leads or traffic now, PPC should probably get the bulk of your short-term budget.\nLaunching a new product? Trying to meet quarterly goals? Paid search and social can give you the volume you need pretty quickly.\nBut if you’re trying to reduce customer acquisition cost (CAC) in the long run or improve visibility in organic search to support brand awareness, SEO deserves more attention. It builds value over time and often pays dividends past the life of your campaign.\nMany brands start with a 70/30 or 60/40 split favoring PPC, then shift the mix as organic efforts gain traction.\nJust make sure you set clear expectations: SEO is not a quick fix, and over-promising short-term gains can backfire when the board wants results next quarter.\nIf you’re rebranding, expanding into new markets, or supporting a product launch, a heavier upfront PPC investment makes sense. But brands that already rank well organically or have strong content foundations can afford to rebalance the mix in favor of SEO.\nOne emerging challenge for organic marketing is the rise of AI Overviews in Google Search. More brands are seeing a dip in organic traffic even when they maintain strong rankings.\nBecause the search experience is shifting. AI-generated summaries are now answering questions directly on the results page, often pushing traditional organic listings further down.\nThat means your SEO strategy can’t just be about rankings anymore. You need to invest in content that earns visibility in AI Overviews, featured snippets, and other enhanced search features.\nThis may involve rethinking how content is structured, focusing more on schema markup , FAQs, and direct-answer formats that AI models tend to surface.\nIn practical terms, your SEO budget should now include:\nThis shift doesn’t mean SEO is no longer worth it. It means you need to be more strategic in how you spend.\nAsk your SEO partner or in-house team how they’re adapting to AI search changes, and make sure your budget reflects that evolution.\nLet’s put this into numbers. Say you have a $100,000 annual digital marketing budget.\nPutting $80,000 toward PPC might get you 25,000 paid clicks and 500 conversions (based on a fictional $3.20 CPC and 2% conversion rate).\nThe remaining $20,000 on SEO might buy you four high-quality articles a month, technical clean-up work, and backlink outreach.\nIf done well, this might start showing traction in three to six months and bring in sustained traffic over time.\nThe key is to model your budget around what’s actually possible for each channel, not just what you hope will happen. SEO efforts often have a longer lag time, but PPC campaigns can run out of gas as soon as you turn off the spend.\nYou should also budget for maintenance and reinvestment. Even strong SEO performance requires fresh content and updates to keep rankings.\nSimilarly, PPC campaigns need regular optimization, creative testing, and bid adjustments to stay efficient.\nYou should also plan for budget allocation across different campaign types: brand vs. non-brand, search vs. display, and prospecting vs. retargeting.\nEach serves a different purpose, and over-investing in one without supporting the others can limit growth.\nFor example, allocating part of your PPC budget to retargeting warm audiences can drastically improve efficiency compared to cold prospecting alone.\nWhile branded search often delivers low-cost conversions, it shouldn’t be your only area of investment if you’re trying to scale.\nLeadership wants to know two things: how much are we spending, and what are we getting in return?\nA mixed SEO and PPC strategy gives you the ability to answer both.\nPPC provides short-term wins you can report on monthly.\nSEO builds long-term momentum that pays off in quarters and years.\nExplain that PPC is more like a faucet you control. SEO is more like building your own well. Both are valuable.\nBut if you only have one or the other, you’re either stuck renting traffic or waiting too long to see the impact.\nBoard members and non-marketing executives often prefer hard numbers. So, when proposing a budget mix, include projected costs per acquisition, estimated traffic volumes, and timelines for ramp-up.\nMake it clear where each dollar is going and what kind of return is expected.\nIf possible, create a model that shows various scenarios. For example, what a 50/50 vs. 70/30 SEO/PPC split might look like in terms of conversions, traffic, and cost per lead over time.\nVisuals help ground the conversation in data rather than preference.\nOne challenge with mixed-channel budget planning is deciding which key performance indicator (KPI) to prioritize.\nPPC is easier to measure in terms of direct return on investment (ROI), but SEO plays a broader role in business success.\nFor PPC metrics , you may want to focus on KPIs like:\nWhen reporting to leadership , show how the two channels complement each other.\nFor example, paid search might drive immediate clicks, but your top-converting landing page could rank organically and reduce spend over time.\nYour initial budget allocation isn’t set in stone. It should evolve based on performance data, market shifts, and internal needs.\nIf PPC costs rise but conversion rates drop, that could be a cue to pull back and invest more in organic.\nIf you’re seeing strong rankings but low engagement, it may be time to shift some SEO funds into conversion rate optimization (CRO) or paid retargeting.\nSeasonality and campaign cycles also matter. Retailers may lean heavily on PPC during Q4, while B2B companies might invest more in SEO during longer sales cycles.\nSet quarterly review points where you re-evaluate performance and make adjustments. That level of agility shows leadership you’re making informed decisions, not just sticking to arbitrary ratios.\nSome companies go all-in on SEO, expecting miracles. Others burn through paid budgets with nothing left to sustain organic efforts. Both approaches are risky.\nDon’t forget to budget for what happens after the click: landing page development, CRO, and reporting tools that tie it all together.\nAnother mistake is treating SEO as a one-time project instead of an ongoing investment. If you only fund it during a site migration or a content sprint, you’ll lose momentum.\nSame goes for PPC: Without a proper landing page experience or conversion tracking, even high-performing ads won’t deliver meaningful results.\nThere is no single formula for how much to invest in SEO or PPC. What you choose depends on what your business needs to achieve, how fast you need results, and how much ongoing support each channel requires to deliver.\nTake a close look at your timelines, your targets, and how each channel is trending. Set expectations early so stakeholders understand what is realistic and what will take time.\nThen, keep an eye on performance as it shifts. The mix that works today may need a reset as your programs mature or your priorities change.\nThe goal is not to pick a winner. The goal is to build a budget strategy that reflects where your business is right now and gives you the flexibility to adjust as conditions evolve."
