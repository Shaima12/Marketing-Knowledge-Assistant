    "content": "Honestly, I don’t think Google can handle this at all. The scale is unprecedented. They went after publishers manually with the site reputation abuse update . More expired domain abuse is reaching the top of the SERPs than at any time I can remember in recent history. They’re fighting a losing battle, and they’ve taken their eye off the ball.\nA few years ago, search was getting on top of the various spam issues “creative” SEOs were trialling. The prospect of being nerfed by a spam update and Google’s willingness to invest and care in the quality of search seemed to be winning the war. Trying to recover from these penalties is nothing short of disastrous. Just ask anybody hit by the Helpful Content update .\nBut things have shifted. AI is haphazardly rewriting the rules, and big tech has bigger, more poisonous fish to fry. This is not a great time to be a white hat SEO.\nVia SpamBrain . Previously, the search giant rolled out Penguin , Panda , and RankBrain to make better decisions based on links and keywords.\nSpamBrain is designed to identify content and websites engaging in spammy activities with apparently “shocking” accuracy. I don’t know whether shocking in this sense is meant in a positive or negative way right now, but I can only parrot what is said.\nOver time, the algorithm learns what is and isn’t spam. Once it has clearly established signals associated with spammy sites, it’s able to create a neural network .\nMuch like the concept of seed sites , if you have the spammiest websites mapped out, you can accurately score everyone else against them. Then you can analyse signals at scale – content, links, behavioral, and reputational signals – to group sites together.\nIf your site is bucketed in the same group as obviously spammy sites when it comes to any of the above, that is not a good sign. The algorithm works on thresholds. I imagine you need to sail pretty close to the wind for long enough to get hit by a spam update.\nBut if your content is relatively thin and low value add, you’re probably halfway there. Add some dangerous links into the mix, some poor business decisions ( parasite SEO being the most obvious example), and scaled content abuse, and you’re doomed.\nGoogle notes the most egregious activities here . We’re talking:\nLots of these are grossly intertwined. Expired domain abuse and PBNs. Keyword stuffing is a little old hat, but link spam is still very much alive and well. Scaled content abuse is at an all-time high across the internet.\nThe more content you have spread across multiple, semantically similar websites, the more effective you can be. Using exact and partial match anchors to leverage your authority towards “money” pages, the richer you will become.\nGoogle Discover – Google’s engagement baiting, social network-lite platform – has been hit by the unscrupulous spammers in recent times. There have been several instances of fake, AI-driven content reaching the masses . It’s become so prevalent, it has even reached legacy media sites (woohoo).\nFrom changing the state pension age to free bus passes and TV licenses, the spammers know the market. They know how to incite emotions. Hell hath no fury like a pensioner scorned, and while you can forgive the odd slip-up, nobody can be this generous.\nThe people who have been working by the book are being sidelined. But the opportunities in the black hat world are booming. Which is, in fairness, quite fun.\nAt the time of writing, over 50% of the content on the internet is AI slop . Some say more. From nearly a million pages analyzed this year, Ahrefs says 74% contain AI-content . What we see is just what slips through the mammoth-sized cracks.\nAccording to award-winning journalist Jean-Marc Manach’s research , he has found over 8,300 AI-generated news websites in French and over 300 in English (the tip of the iceberg, trust me).\nHe estimates two of these site owners have become millionaires.\nBy leveraging authoritative, expired domains and PBNs (more on that next), SEOs – the people still ruining the internet – know how to game the system. By faking clicks, manipulating engagement signals , and utilizing past link equity effectively.\nIf you engage even a little bit with a black hat community, you’ll know how easy it is right now to leverage expired domains . In the example below, someone had bought the London Road Safety website (a once highly authoritative domain) and turned it into a single-page “best betting sites not on GamStop” site.\nBetting and crypto are ground zero for all things black hat, just because there’s so much money involved.\nI’m not an expert here, but I believe the process is as follows:\nThese scams are always short-term plays. But they can be worth tens of hundreds of thousands of pounds when done well. And they are back, and I believe more valuable than ever.\nRight now, I think it’s as simple as buying an old charity domain, adding a quick reskin and voila. A 301 or equity passing tactic and your single page site about ‘best casinos not on gamstop’ is printing money. Even in the English speaking market.\nAccording to notorious black hat fella Charles Floate, some of these companies are laundering hundreds of thousands of pounds a month .\nA PBN (or Private Blog Network) is a network of websites that someone controls that link back to the money site. The variation of the site designed to generate typically advertising or affiliate revenue.\nA private blog network has to be completely unique from each other. They cannot share breadcrumbs that Google can trace. Each site needs a standalone:\nThe reason PBNs are so valuable is you can build up an enormous amount of link equity and falsified topical authority to mitigate risk. Expired domains are risky because they’re expensive, and once they get a penalty, they’re doomed. PBNs spread the risk. Like the head of a Hydra, one dies; another rises up.\nProtecting the tier 1 asset (the purchased aged or expired domain) is paramount. Instead of pointing links directly to the money site, you can link to the sites that link to the money site .\nThis indirectly boosts the value of the money site, protecting it from Google’s prying eyes.\nAs always, this is an inexact science. Barely even pseudo-science really. I’ve got the tinfoil hat on and a lot of string connecting wild snippets of information around the room to make this work. You should follow Shaun Anderson here.\nIf I take every mention of the word “spam” in the module names and descriptions, there are around 115, once I’ve removed any nonsense. Then we can categorize those into content, links, reputational, and behavioral signals.\nTaking it one step further, these modules can be classified as relating to things like link building, anchor text, content quality, et al. This gives us a rough sense of what matters in terms of scale .\nReally, the takeaway is how important links are from a spam sense. Particularly, anchor text . The velocity at which you gain links matters. As does the text and surrounding content. Linking seems to be where Google’s algorithm is most capable of identifying red and amber flags.\nIf your link velocity graph spiked with exact match anchors to highly commercial pages, that’s a flag. Once a site is pinged for this type of content or link-related abuse, the behavioral and reputational signals are analysed as part of SpamBrain.\nIf these corroborate and your site exceeds certain thresholds, you’re doomed. It’s why this has (until recently) been a relatively fine art.\nAs Martin McGarry pointed out , they just care a bit less … They have bigger, more hallucinogenic fish to fry.\nIn 2025, we have had four updates, with a duration of c. 70 days. In 2024, we had seven that lasted almost 130 days. Productivity levels we can all aspire to.\nThe bleeding-edge search experience is changing. Google is rolling out preferred publisher sources globally and inline linking more effectively in its AI products. Much-needed changes.\nI think we’re seeing the real-time moulding of the new search experience in the form of The Google Web Guide . A personalized mix of trusted sources, AI Mode, a more classic search interface, and something inspirational. I suspect this might be a little like a Discover-lite feed. A place in the traditional search interface where content you will almost certainly like is fed to you to keep you engaged.\nUnconfirmed, but apparently, Google has added persona-driven recommendation signals and a private publisher entity layer , among other things. Grouping users into cohorts is I believe a fundamental part of Discover. It’s what allows content to go viral.\nOnce you understand enough about a user to bucket them into specific groups, you can saturate a market over the course of a few days Discover. Less even. But the problem is the economics of it all. Ten blue links are cheap. AI is not. At any level.\nAccording to Google, when someone chooses a preferred source, they click through to that site twice as often on average. So I suspect it’s worth taking seriously.\nGoogle is going to spend $10 billion more this year than expected due to the growing demand for cloud services. YoY, Google’s CAPEX spend is nearly double 2024’s $52.5 billion.\nIt’s not just Google. It’s a Silicon Valley race to the bottom.\nWhile Google hasn’t released public information on this, it’s no secret that AI searches are significantly more expensive than the classic 10 blue links. Traditional search is largely static and retrieval-based. It relies on pre-indexed pages to serve a list of links and is very cheap to run.\nAn AI Overview is generative. Google has to run a large language model to summarize and generate a natural language answer. AI Mode is significantly worse. The multi-turn, conversational interface processes the entire dialogue in addition to the new query.\nGiven the query fan-out technique – where dozens of searches are run in parallel – this process demands significantly more computational power.\nCustom chips, efficiencies, and caching can reduce the cost of this. But this is one of Google’s biggest challenges. I suspect exactly why Barry believes AI Mode won’t be the default search experience . I’d be surprised if it isn’t just applied at a search/personalization level, too. There are plenty of branded and navigational searches where this would be an enormous waste of money.\nAccording to The IET , if the population of London (>9.7 million) asked ChatGPT to write a 100-word email this would require 4,874,000 litres of water to cool the servers – equivalent to filling over seven 25m swimming pools\nThis is pretty well documented. LLMs seem to be driven at least in part by the sheer volume of mentions in the training data . Everything is ingested and taken as read.\nWhen you add a line in your footer describing something you or your business did, it’s taken as read. Spammy, low-quality tactics work more effectively than heavy lifting.\nIdeally, we wouldn’t live in a world where low-lift shit outperforms proper marketing efforts. But here we are.\nLike in 2012, “best” lists are on the tip of everyone’s tongue. Basic SEO is making a comeback because that’s what is currently working in LLMs. Paid placements, reciprocal link exchanges. You name it.\nAs these models rely on Google’s index for searches that the model cannot confidently answer ( RAG ), Google’s spam engine matters more than ever. In the same way that I think publishers need to take a stand against big tech and AI, Google needs to step up and take this seriously.\nI’m not even sure they want to right now. OpenAI has signed some pretty extraordinary contracts , and its revenue is light-years away from where it needs to be. And Google’s CAPEX expenditure is through the roof.\nSo, things like quality and accuracy are not at the top of the list. Consumer and investor confidence is not that high . They need to make some money. And private companies can be a bit laissez-faire when it comes to reporting on revenue and profits.\nAccording to HSBC, OpenAI needs to raise at least $207 billion by 2030 so it can continue to lose money . Being described as ‘a money pit with a website on top’ isn’t a great look.\nLet’s see them post-hoc rationalize their way out of this one. That’s it. Thank you for reading and subscribing to my last update of the year. Certainly been a year.\nThis post was originally published on Leadership in SEO ."

    "date": "2025-12-16T13:00:03+00:00",
    "content": "Inside many companies, SEO reporting still relies heavily on mainstream metrics like keyword tracking, traffic graphs, etc., while the leadership side asks a different question: “How much revenue did this actually drive?”\nYears ago, I used to think this was just a communication gap. Over time, I realized the issue wasn’t communication at all; it was measurement. Most SEO dashboards stop at visibility and traffic, so of course, decision-makers don’t see the true value.\nTraditional metrics tell us only how users arrive. They reveal almost nothing about what happens after the click. However, we need to know if users find what they need, engage with content, move through key journeys, and ultimately convert.\nBut the real value-generating user journey continues beyond that:\nImpression > Click > Landing > Engagement > Micro-Conversion > Conversion/Drop-off.\nWhat I noticed is that SEO value isn’t missing, but it’s hidden in steps three to six. Once I started looking at the efforts we do through this perspective, opportunities that weren’t visible before became obvious. And many of the biggest wins came from improving how existing traffic behaved.\nThe conversation shifts from “traffic grew” to “we removed friction from this journey and unlocked X conversions.” It’s a very different level of clarity for you and for stakeholders.\nYou don’t need a giant analytics overhaul to start seeing better insights. A couple of simple steps are enough to learn where the story breaks.\nGoogle Analytics 4 already gives you the tools; you just need a structured approach.\nOnce the Exploration report page appears, a set of metrics will be pre-configured by default. To analyse a specific user journey the way you want, you must customize the metrics as explained in the second step.\nMy example conditions in the Steps feature Designmodo products, the company I work for.\nImportant Note: I strongly recommend creating custom events , which are the biggest advantage of GA4, to track specific user actions. With this way, you can go beyond pre-defined events and uncover useful insights. For example, if you want to track signups or call-to-action button clicks, then creating custom events will save your life.\nOnce the funnel is working, drag the Dimensions you want from the Set Variables column and drop them into the Breakdown section. Breaking the data down by dimensions can help uncover some opportunities. For example:\nThese breakdowns often explain patterns that traffic metrics can’t.\nOnce you’ve built this perfect funnel, a really smart thing to do is to save it as a custom report in your GA4 library. It means it will be there in the left navigation, just as the default reports, whenever you want to check it. You can monitor that user journey consistently, spot trends, detect frictions, and react faster.\nSpending time on low-impact actions creates the illusion of progress but rarely drives meaningful results. Focusing on high-value action that is closely tied to business outcomes ensures effort actually turns into impact.\nThis makes long-term reporting harder than it needs to be. Use clear, descriptive, and short naming for your explorations and collections.\nSometimes, the biggest opportunity isn’t the step with the most volume, but the one closest to conversion. Therefore, when analyzing funnel drop-offs, I recommend that you look for:\nSharing knowledge is scaling, and not sharing is one of the quickest ways to slow a team down. Regular knowledge-sharing ensures everyone understands the “why” behind decisions, strengthens collaboration, and builds a culture where information flows instead of bottlenecks.\nYou don’t need to do everything at once. Here’s a simple 30-day approach:\nAs soon as you start tracking full user journeys, you gain a completely different level of perspective. It becomes easier to prioritize improvements, justify recommendations, and show how your efforts contribute to business outcomes.\nThe biggest mindset shift for me was realizing that SEO efforts are not only for welcoming visitors but also for improving their experiences within the website once they get there.\nBut of course, you don’t need to build everything at once. Start small, then scale systematically."

    "title": "Eight Overlooked Reasons Why Sites Lose Rankings In Core Updates via @sejournal, @martinibuster",
    "date": "2025-12-16T10:17:44+00:00",
    "content": "There are multiple reasons why a site can drop in rankings due to a core algorithm update. The reasons may reflect specific changes to the way Google interprets content, a search query, or both. The change could also be subtle, like an infrastructure update that enables finer relevance and quality judgments. Here are eight commonly overlooked reasons for why a site may have lost rankings after a Google core update.\nIf the site was previously ranking well and now it doesn’t, it could be what I call “it’s ranking where it’s supposed to rank.” That means that some part of Google’s algorithm has caught up to a loophole that the page was intentionally or accidentally taking advantage of and is currently ranking it where it should have been ranking in the first place.\nThis is difficult to diagnose because a publisher might believe that the web pages or links were perfect the way they previously were, but in fact there was an issue.\nA part of the ranking process is determining what the topic of a web page is. Google admitted a year ago that a core topicality system is a part of the ranking process. The concept of topicality as part of the ranking algorithm is real.\nThe so-called Medic Update of 2018 brought this part of Google’s algorithm into sharp focus. Suddenly, sites that were previously relevant for medical keywords were nowhere to be found because they dealt in folk remedies, not medical ones. What happened was that Google’s understanding of what keyword phrases were about became more topically focused.\nBill Slawski wrote about a Google patent ( Website representation vector ) that describes a way to classify websites by knowledge domains and expertise levels that sounds like a direct match to what the Medic Update was about.\n“The search system can use information for a search query to determine a particular website classification that is most responsive to the search query and select only search results with that particular website classification for a search results page. For example, in response to receipt of a query about a medical condition, the search system may select only websites in the first category, e.g., authored by experts, for a search results page.”\nGoogle’s interpretation of what it means to be relevant became increasingly about topicality in 2018 and continued to be refined in successive updates over the years. Instead of relying on links and keyword similarity, Google introduced a way to identify and classify sites by knowledge domain (the topic) in order to better understand how search queries and content are relevant to each other.\nReturning to the medical queries, the reason many sites lost rankings during the Medic Update was that their topics were outside the knowledge domain of medical remedies and science. Sites about folk and alternative healing were permanently locked out of ranking for medical phrases, and no amount of links could ever restore their rankings. The same thing happened across many other topics and continues to affect rankings as Google’s ability to understand the nuances of topical relevance is updated.\nA way to think of topical theming is to consider that keyword phrases can be themed by topic. For example, the keyword phrase “bomber jacket” is related to both military clothing, flight clothing, and men’s jackets. At the time of writing, Alpha Industries, a manufacturer of military clothing, is ranked number one in Google. Alpha Industries is closely related to military clothing because the company not only focuses on selling military style clothing, it started out as a military contractor producing clothing for America’s military, so it’s closely identified by consumers with military clothing.\nSo it’s not surprising that Alpha Industries ranks #1 for bomber jacket because it ticks both boxes for the topicality of the phrase Bomber Jacket:\nIf your page was previously ranking and now it isn’t, then it’s possible that the topical theme was redefined more sharply. The only way to check this is to review the top ranked sites, focusing, for example, on the differences between ranges such as position one and two, or sometimes positions one through three or positions one through five. The range depends on how the topic is themed. In the example of the Bomber Jacket rankings, positions one through three are themed by “military clothing” and “Men’s clothing.” Position three in my example is held by the Thursday Boot Company, which is themed more closely with “men’s clothing” than it is with military clothing. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Thursday Boot Company is closely identified with men’s fashion.\nThis is a way to analyze the SERPs to understand why sites are ranking and why others are not.\nSometimes the topical themes are not locked into place because user intents can change. In that case, opening a new browser or searching a second time in a different tab might cause Google to change the topical theme to a different topical intent.\nIn the case of the “bomber jacket” search results, the hierarchy of topical themes can change to:\nThe reason for that is directly related to the user’s information need which informs the intent and the correct topic. In the above case it looks like the military clothing theme may be the dominant user intent for this topic but the informational/discovery intent may be a close tie that’s triggered by personalization. This can vary by previous searches but also by geographic location, a user’s device, and even by the time of day.\nThe takeaway is that there may not be anything wrong with a site. It’s just ranking for a more specific topical intent. So if the topic is getting personalized so that your page no longer ranks, a solution may be to create another page to focus on the additional topic theme that Google is ranking.\nIn one sense, authoritativeness can be seen as an external validation of expertise of a website as a go-to source for a product, service, or content topic. While the expertise of the author contributes to authoritativeness and authoritativeness in a topic can be inherent to a website, ultimately it’s third-party recognition from readers, customers, and other websites (in the form of citations and links) that communicate a website’s authoritativeness back to Google as a validating signal.\nTo that we can add the previously discussed Website Representation Vector patent that shows how Google can identify expertise and authoritativeness.\nWhat’s going on then is that Google selects relevant content and then winnows that down by prioritizing expert content.\n“Google’s automated systems are designed to use many different factors to rank great content. After identifying relevant content, our systems aim to prioritize those that seem most helpful. To do this, they identify a mix of factors that can help determine which content demonstrates aspects of experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness, or what we call E-E-A-T.”\nAuthoritativeness is not about how often a site publishes about a topic; any spammer can do that. It has to be about more than that. E-E-A-T is a standard to hold your site up to.\nSpeaking of E-E-A-T, many SEOs have the mistaken idea that it’s something they can add to websites. That’s not how it works. At the 2025 New York City Search Central Live event, Google’s John Mueller confirmed that E-E-A-T is not something you add to web pages .\n“Sometimes SEOs come to us or like mention that they’ve added EEAT to their web pages. That’s not how it works. Sorry, you can’t sprinkle some experiences on your web pages. It’s like, that doesn’t make any sense.”\nClearly, content reflects qualities of authoritativeness, trustworthiness, expertise, and experience, but it’s not something that you add to content. So what is it?\nE-E-A-T is just a standard to hold your site up to. It’s also a subjective judgment made by site visitors. A subjective judgment is like how a sandwich can taste great, with the “great” part being the subjective judgment. It is a matter of opinion.\nOne thing that is difficult for SEOs to diagnose is when their content is missing that extra something to push their site onto the first page of the SERPs. It can feel unfair to see competitors ranking on the first page of the SERPs even though your content is just as good as theirs.\nThose differences indicate that their top-ranked web pages are optimized for people. Another reason is that more people know about them because they have a multimodal approach to content, whereas the site on page two of the SERPs mainly communicates via textual content.\nIn SERPs where Google prefers to rank government and educational sites for a particular keyword phrase, except for one commercial site, I almost always find evidence that their content and their outreach are resonating with site visitors in ways that the competitor websites do not. Websites that focus on multimodal, people-optimized content and experiences are usually what I find in those weird outlier rankings.\nSo if your site is stuck on page two, revisit the top-ranked web pages and identify ways that those sites are optimized for people and multimodal content. You may be surprised to see what makes those sites resonate with users.\nSome rankings are not made to last. This is the case with a new site or new page ranking boost. Google has a thing where it tastes a new site to see how it fits with the rest of the Internet. A lot of SEOs crow about their client’s new website conquering the SERPs right out of the gate. What you almost never hear about is when those same sites drop out of the SERPs.\nThis isn’t a bad thing. It’s normal. It simply means that Google has tried the site and now it’s time for the site to earn its place in the SERPs.\nMany site publishers find it frustrating to be told that there’s nothing wrong with their site even though it lost rankings. What’s going on may be that the site and web page are fine, but that the competitors’ pages are finer. These kinds of issues are typically where the content is fine and the competitors’ content is about the same but is better in small ways.\nThis is the one form of ranking drop that many SEOs and publishers easily overlook because SEOs generally try to identify what’s “wrong” with a site, and when nothing obvious jumps out at them, they try to find something wrong with the backlinks or something else.\nThis inability to find something wrong leads to recommendations like filing link disavows to get rid of spam links or removing content to fix perceived but not actual problems (like duplicate content). They’re basically grasping at straws to find something to fix.\nBut sometimes it’s not that something is wrong with the site. Sometimes it’s just that there’s something right with the competitors.\nOptimizing for people is a common blind spot. Optimizing for people is a subset of conversion optimization. Conversion optimization is about subtle signals that indicate a web page contains what the site visitor needs.\nSometimes that need is to be recognized and acknowledged. It can be reassurance that you’re available right now or that the business is trustworthy.\nFor example, a client’s site featured a badge at the top of the page that said something like “Trusted by over 200 of the Fortune 500.” That badge whispered, “We’re legitimate and trustworthy.”\nAnother example is how a business identified that most of their site visitors were mothers of boys, so their optimization was to prioritize images of mothers with boys. This subtly recognized the site visitor and confirmed that what’s being offered is for them.\nNobody loves a site because it’s heavily SEO’d, but people do love sites that acknowledge the site visitor in some way. This is the secret sauce that’s invisible to SEO tools but helps sites outrank their competitors.\nIt may be helpful to avoid mimicking what competitors are doing and increase ways that differentiate the site and outreach in ways that make people like your site more. When I say outreach, I mean actively seeking out places where your typical customer might be hanging out and figuring out how you can make your pitch there. Third-party signals have long been strong ranking factors at Google, and now, with AI Search, what people and other sites say about your site are increasingly playing a role in rankings.\nRanking changes after a core update sometimes reflect clearer judgments about relevance, authority, and usefulness rather than newly discovered web page flaws. As Google sharpens how it understands topics, pages increasingly compete on how well they align with what users are actually trying to accomplish and which sources people already recognize and trust. The lasting advantage comes from building a site that resonates with actual visitors, earns attention beyond search, and gives Google consistent evidence that users prefer it over alternatives. Marketing, the old-fashioned tell-people-about-a-business approach to promoting it, should not be overlooked.\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Silapavet Konthikamee"

    "content": "As every network continues to prioritize video, the brands breaking through think like media companies. They’re investing in storytelling, partnerships and in-house content creation. They view video as a long-term content growth engine, not a one-off campaign deliverable.\nUnder Armour’s launch of Lab96 Studios —an in-house content studio producing everything from short-form social videos to docuseries—reflects that shift. Branded series like Bilt’s Roomies feel more like bingeable entertainment than traditional brand content. Both brands signal how brands design video marketing strategy to build awareness and loyal viewers.\nCreating a successful social media video marketing strategy isn’t just about short-form vs. long-form content anymore. It’s about adapting to the broader evolution of how video works across networks. Lo-fi formats are the norm. Episodic content keeps audiences coming back for more. Intellectual influencers create impact with expertise and perspective, not just aesthetics and product recommendations. AI supports all areas of production from storyboarding to audio cleanup.\nVideo has shifted from a “nice to have” to a core content format. It requires creating a sustainable, on-brand strategy that drives results. In this guide, we’ll break down how to build a strong video strategy step by step, the popular types of videos to use and best practices to help your content perform.\nYou can also watch the video below for a crash course, including tips for scaling your video process from pre-production to post-publishing:\nA video marketing strategy defines how video supports your overall marketing and content strategy. It outlines the types of video you will use and key networks. Rather than existing as a standalone effort, it aligns video with brand goals and business outcomes.\nIt clarifies why video is being created, who it’s for and where it fits across the customer journey, while establishing consistency around messaging, formats and distribution.\nVideo supports every stage of the marketing funnel. It attracts attention fast, builds trust quickly and helps audiences understand your brand in seconds. It converts customers and gives a platform for advocates. Across platforms, short-form video is the top ROI driver for 71% of video marketers .\nBeyond the bottom line, video plays a key role in social media search . Consumers discover brands through Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube Shorts and Reddit threads. They’re also finding video on search engine results pages (SERPs) like Google, and using LLMs for live search like ChatGPT and Perplexity.\nWhen done well, video works like a conveyor belt, moving audiences from awareness to action without friction.\nThere’s no one way to succeed with video. Different formats help you meet different goals, from educating your audience to showcasing your product to humanizing your brand. Here are some of the most common types of social video, along with real examples to inspire your approach.\nEducational videos teach something useful and position your brand as an expert. Peloton does this well by sharing trainer-led technique videos—like this lower-back stretch routine—which helps both new and current customers get more value from their workouts.\nExplainer videos break down how your product or service works. Asana’s beginner guide is a strong example. It walks new users through projects, tasks and inbox workflows to reduce onboarding friction.\nBehind-the-scenes content gives audiences a peek into how your company operates. Prose’s factory tour, led by their social team, humanizes the brand while showcasing how their products are made to order.\nInterviews introduce your audience to new perspectives while adding credibility. This conversation between Canva Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Cameron Adams and OpenAI’s Head of Revenue pairs expert insight with an engaging guest format.\nThese videos use humor or relatable moments to build community. Shopify nails this with playful TikTok videos like this “entrepreneur’s camera roll” bit, which reinforces their brand personality while making viewers laugh.\nTestimonials build trust by showing real customers and outcomes. Intuit’s story featuring Fur Bar Toronto shows how their tools help a small business grow, so the value feels tangible.\nProduct videos highlight features in action. Dyson’s engineer-led demo of their V16 Piston Animal showcases innovation and performance in a clear, visual way.\nNarrative videos tell a story that connects emotionally. Sweetgreen’s “Faces of the Farm” series introduces real farmers, like Dan Drake, adding authenticity and depth to their sourcing story.\nCulture videos spotlight your people and values. Ritual’s team-centered clips, like this IRL “spot us in the wild” moment, showcase their mission and community in action.\nThought leadership videos feature experts sharing insights. Gusto’s clip of their co-founder on The Room Podcast positions the brand as a leader in small business tools and AI innovation.\nBrand story videos explain who you are and why you exist. Fly By Jing’s YouTube Short about its founder’s Sichuan origins captures the brand’s heritage and mission in a simple but powerful way.\nEveryone’s making videos, but not everyone is strategic about it. A focused plan helps you choose the right formats, platforms and stories for your brand. Here’s how to create a strategy that’s intentional and effective.\nAt the beginning of any new marketing strategy, you’ll start by setting goals . What do you want your videos to achieve?\nIf you’re just starting, we recommend setting only a few goals to avoid getting overwhelmed. An example of a video marketing goal is to generate brand awareness.\nBut with the right script and creativity, your video marketing strategy can do more than boost brand awareness. It guides prospects through the decision stage, educates customers and fuels a brand’s advocacy plans. Video can fall into each of the five stages of the marketing funnel as long as you develop your video marketing strategy to align with each one.\nAs you reflect on your video marketing goals, consider how they align with each stage of the buyer’s journey, and use that insight to inform your social media video ideas . Identifying the funnel stage will also help you create highly effective calls to action in your video content.\nHere are five example goals you can achieve within each funnel stage:\nAccording to The 2024 Sprout Social Media Content Strategy Report , social media users are turning to video-centric channels like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok for product discovery. These are more than “social networks” for audiences, especially Millennial and Gen Z consumers. Digital video content is a way to find and vet brands, products and services.\nIn the first stage of the buyer’s journey, brands are trying to capture consumers’ attention and introduce themselves. Social media video marketing is an effective way to reach new customers and showcase who you are, what you value, what your brand offers and what sets it apart from competitors.\nIn a video, you may have only seconds or minutes to capture your audience’s attention. Get right to the point when you’re creating awareness-stage video content. For example, eye-catching educational videos or opinionated thought leadership can establish credibility and your brand identity, so when consumers intend to buy, your brand is top of mind.\nSome brands rely heavily on videos for advertising. These videos can appear on a brand’s website, product pages or in social ads across networks. This is especially useful for direct-to-consumer brands like Gymshark, where product videos help consumers visualize how to use the gear and understand what makes each collection stand out.\nGymshark recently spotlighted the return of their fan-favorite Onyx V5 collection. The cinematic clip features Gymshark athletes training in the new pieces, shot in an action-movie or superhero-sequence style. The dramatic lighting, slow-motion lifts and close-ups of the fabric create a high-impact moment that immediately communicates the strength and performance the collection is designed for.\nThe video is bold, visually engaging and optimized for quick attention across channels. It works as an organic Instagram Reel, TikTok post, YouTube Short or a paid social ad.\nOnce consumers have reached the consideration stage, they may know about your brand and what you offer, but it’s still your job to generate demand for your products and services.\nThere are several ways to achieve this goal through social media video marketing. For example, how-tos and tutorials show your product in action and help consumers envision how they’d use it. Brands in the skincare, makeup and wellness spaces—such as Australian beauty brand Frank Body—excel at consideration-stage video.\nFrank Body frequently shares short-form videos featuring influencers, creators, customers and staff members using the brand’s products in their daily lives. In the example below, nano-influencer @maya_andrejev walks through her nighttime ritual using Frank Body’s Tired Babes Kit, first applying the magnesium scrub and then the Body Therapy Oil. The content feels cozy, relatable and perfectly aligned to the results the product promises.\nWhen people can see how someone else uses your product to solve a problem or elevate their day, it becomes easier to imagine themselves doing the same.\nAnimated explainer videos are an alternative option to live-action demonstrations. Though more abstract, they’re still an opportunity to put the customer’s problem into perspective and introduce your services as the solution.\nLean into this consumer interest by using video to highlight your brand story and core values. You’ll establish an emotional connection with your audience, making it more likely they’ll choose your company over a competitor.\nThe decision stage is when prospects are weighing their options and are closest to becoming customers. Here, customer testimonial videos can go a long way to show the real potential and payoff of your products and services.\nAn example of this comes from Monday.com , which shares polished customer stories that highlight how teams use their platform to solve real operational challenges. In the video below, the company features three members of Knight Frank’s global marketing team.\nEach person shares how they unified fragmented workflows across four divisions using Monday.com. Their interviews are intercut with clear visualizations of dashboards and automations, giving viewers a tangible look at how the platform transforms day-to-day operations.\nIt’s aspirational, but rooted in reality. Viewers can easily picture their teams overcoming similar obstacles, which makes this a high-impact conversion asset. When prospects see how someone in their role, industry or challenge set succeeded with your product, it builds trust and reduces friction in the buying process. Also, note that they include several call-to-action links in the description.\nUse this type of video content to show potential customers the results and tangible benefits others have achieved, and what they stand to gain by choosing your business.\nIt’s not just marketers who want to make sure they’re seeing a return on their investments. Once a prospect becomes a customer and enters the adoption stage, educate them on how to get the most out of your products and services.\nAn energetic how-to video is ideal for platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn or Instagram Reels, where people are willing to spend more time watching and learning.\nBy the advocacy stage, you have satisfied customers who’ll sing your praises and champion your brand.\nThe beauty of advocacy videos is that customers don’t feel like they’re being sold to. Capitalize on organic, genuine love for your brand and product using social listening tools like Sprout Social. With Sprout Social Listening, you can capture brand mentions from engaged profiles and surface user-generated content.\nNot every advocacy video will be viral or come straight from your fans. Consider creating employee advocacy content with your colleagues to show the ins and outs of your company and why they love working there.\nEvery major social media network has a form of video, so there’s plenty of real estate to incorporate it into your strategy.\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the most popular video-friendly networks and what they’re best for:\nIf you’ve never used video on any platform, begin with the ones where you already have an active audience. Then expand into platforms that align with your goals and your content style.\nTo choose the right platform for your brand’s video marketing, you need to understand what each platform offers and which video dimensions it supports. If you’d like to repurpose your videos, it’s best to choose platforms that complement each other. Many platforms (including Reels, TikTok and YouTube Shorts) use a 9×16 vertical video aspect ratio, making it easy to cross-post your video on all of them.\nAs different social platforms add more features, it can be hard to keep track of which types of video content to post where, or when you might need to do some additional editing.\nSee below for a quick reference, but visit our full social media video specs guide for all the details you need to upload on each network.\nOnce you’ve identified the video formats you want to use, the next step is to define how those videos should look, sound and feel across platforms. Your video branding shapes how easily people recognize your content and how well it reflects your brand identity.\nStart by choosing the video types that best support your goals, whether that’s educational Reels, product explainers, behind-the-scenes clips or narrative storytelling. From there, think through your branding approach. Will each format have a unique visual style, or will all content adhere to your overarching brand guidelines? Some brands use consistent color palettes, music, motion graphics or on-screen text, while others opt for a looser style that feels native to each network.\nAlso consider how prominent you want branding to be. For some videos, subtle branding, like a recognizable editing style or tone, is enough. For others, especially product or testimonial videos, more explicit branding helps reinforce trust and recall.\nInfluencer and creator content is another variable. If you often work with influencers, the video will likely be more personality-driven and your branding may be more flexible.d. If you’re producing most videos in-house, you may have tighter brand control.\nClarifying these choices early will help ensure your videos feel cohesive, recognizable and aligned with your strategy as you move into production planning.\nContent themes give your video strategy structure. Think of them as the core pillars that guide what you talk about, how you show up and each video’s objective. Themes help you maintain consistency across platforms, streamline ideation and keep your content aligned with your larger marketing goals.\nStart by defining three to five themes that support your strategy. For example: product education, customer success stories, thought leadership, company culture or behind-the-scenes storytelling. Each theme should connect to a business objective, such as building awareness, driving consideration or supporting conversion.\nOnce you’ve set your themes, use them to shape your topics, video formats and creative style. If one of your themes is “customer proof,” you might plan a mix of testimonial clips, case-study snippets and creator-led “I tried this” videos. If another theme is “brand expertise,” you might focus on explainers, tutorials or thought-leadership content.\nWith defined themes, your video library becomes easier to plan and scale, and more cohesive for your audience. Every piece of content has a purpose, and every video contributes to your broader story.\nA good content production plan will save you time and money in the long run.\nStart by mapping out your content calendar. It should outline video topics, filming schedules and publishing dates. A clear calendar helps you batch similar shoots, manage approvals, coordinate talent and ensure your videos ladder up to broader campaign timelines. It also keeps your publishing schedule consistent across networks.\nThen evaluate your content production and post-production options. Hiring an agency or production company can help you handle all the planning and approvals while you provide guidance.\nIf you’re keeping it in-house, you’ll need to consider these steps:\nAs you run through the content plan, you’ll find ways to tweak it or things you missed earlier, especially if this is one of your first efforts at putting together a comprehensive video content plan. Be ready to adjust where needed. Once you have a solid plan and production workflow, you’re ready to move into post-production.\nAllow plenty of time for post-production, especially if you will use videos for ads or have heavier editing needs. Post-production does not mean simply cutting scenes and reassembling them to music. It also includes features such as closed captions, text overlays, call-to-action screens, and more. The more you film and the more polished you want your video to be, the more time you’ll need.\nSome videos will only require light post-production edits. For example, if you host a Facebook Live, the video is published immediately after it ends. You’ll be able to edit the caption and title, but not much else.\nUploaded videos will go through post-production. On YouTube, for example, you’ll be able to add tags, multiple language closed captions, detailed captions and more.\nKnow what you’re getting yourself into before you start: formal, polished videos on YouTube require a lot more work than a basic livestream.\nNow that you have the completed video, it’s time to schedule and promote it. Some management platforms, such as Sprout Social, offer video publishing options.\nSprout supports scheduling and publishing video across all major networks—including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn and X—directly from a single unified calendar. Our built-in Video Editor makes it easy to trim clips, and Generate Subtitles by AI Assist creates accurate, accessible captions in a few clicks.\nDon’t think of videos on social media as one-and-done. One film recording session can produce multiple videos that you can repurpose across channels. Use different cuts and formats to create new variations. Think big when you’re promoting videos.\nUse your owned channels to extend the reach of every video. On top of posting on your socials, embed videos on relevant website pages, include them in email newsletters, repurpose clips for blog posts and share them across your brand’s community spaces. Consistent cross-channel distribution reinforces your message and increases discoverability.\nPaid social gives your videos an added boost. Use paid placements on networks such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and LinkedIn to reach new audiences or retarget warm prospects. Also consider turning influencer content into ads and boosting them through your brand accounts to reach a wider audience.\nOptimize your video SEO for discovery across social search and beyond. Add keyword-rich titles, captions and descriptions, use native tagging features and design your opening frames to align with user intent. Social videos increasingly surface in external search engines (like Google) and in LLMs with live search, so clear metadata and accessible formats help your content get found wherever people are looking.\nThe last step in any strategy is the most important: analysis and reflection. You won’t know how a video performs unless you review the underlying data. What are the view counts? The watch times? The shares, likes and comments? Are people completing the video or dropping off early? How many clicked through or converted?\nEach network provides a different set of video metrics, so you need to know which ones it offers before you start production. The metrics you track should map directly to your goals:\nSprout offers a full suite of cross-network analytics that make it easy to compare performance across networks, track trends over time and identify what’s resonating.\nUse analytics and social listening together to refine your strategy. While performance data tells you what worked, listening reveals what audiences are saying, searching for and responding to. Combined, they help you improve creative decisions, adjust your themes and identify new opportunities for video content.\nKeep in mind that audiences will watch your older videos. With the right combination of keywords and an evergreen topic, a three-year-old video might still be relevant to your users today.\nEvery brand wants to unlock the power of video, but few feel confident doing it.\nAccording to VEED’s Ultimate Guide to Video Marketing , 98% of UK and US marketers say video is important to their strategy, yet 83% aren’t sure where to start. Only 38% feel confident creating video, and 62% experience negative emotions when asked to do it. Two-thirds describe the process as overwhelming or creatively blocking.\nThe attention economy amplifies pressure, with short-form video and video ads often the fastest way to stop the scroll. These best practices help you cut through the noise and create video content that drives results.\nAnalyze your audience’s demographics, behaviors and platform preferences to understand which styles and formats resonate. Review your top-performing videos and use social listening to identify the questions, challenges and moments your audience cares about. Aligning your content with real needs and motivations will make your videos more relevant and engaging.\nShort-form video dominates most networks, but long-form still thrives on YouTube and other search-driven platforms. Use a mix of both to support your full funnel, based on your goals, resources and capacity. If you invest in long-form, repurpose it into multiple short-form clips to extend reach and maximize ROI. Think of longer videos as raw material for bite-sized content across networks.\nGreat storytelling pulls people in, holds attention and leaves an impression long after the scroll. We love the short-form storytelling framework Craft & Release shared at CultureCon 2025 :\nTalent can make or break your video. Choose creators, influencers or employees who appear natural on camera and embody your brand’s personality.\nAt Sprout, we activate employees through our Employee Creative Network. It’s a group of 100+ individual contributors and leaders who contribute authentic, employee-led video content. Employee-generated content (EGC) consistently outperforms polished branded content, so don’t overlook your internal talent pool. Use Sprout Tagging or custom tracking to measure what styles and voices resonate most.\nWell-defined expectations and timelines reduce delays and protect the quality of the final product. Set creative requirements upfront: scope, visual guidelines, brand guardrails and non-negotiables. Designate approvers and set a cutoff for feedback so revisions don’t spiral out of control.\nMap out costs for pre-production, equipment, talent, editing, paid distribution and accessibility needs. Prioritize the formats and themes that offer the highest ROI for your goals. A clear-cut budget helps prevent scope creep, keeps teams aligned and ensures every dollar contributes to a measurable outcome.\nGood audio instantly elevates your video quality. Use a reliable microphone or quiet recording setup, and avoid distracting background noise. Always include captions for accessibility and sound-off viewers. Captions improve comprehension, boost watch time and increase discoverability across platforms.\nAI streamlines video creation from start to finish. Use it to surface insights from past performance, generate ideas, outline scripts, refine messaging and optimize posting. In production and post-production, AI tools can help trim clips, format videos, generate subtitles and speed up editing. Treat AI as an assistant that reduces manual work, enabling your team to focus on storytelling and strategy.\nRepurposing multiplies your video’s impact. Reels, TikToks and YouTube Shorts share the same 9×16 vertical format, making cross-posting simple with minor edits. Break long-form videos into short clips for broader reach across platforms. Repurposing ensures more people see your best ideas, extends the lifespan of your content and helps you maintain a consistent publishing cadence without starting from scratch.\nSocial media video marketing is one powerful piece of your broader content strategy. Setting clear goals and aligning your video approach with your overall social plan helps you choose the right platforms, formats and workflows. With thoughtful production, intentional promotion and ongoing analysis, you’ll be ready to create videos that stand out and earn attention in a fast-moving feed.\nAs social becomes the new search engine, your content also needs to be easy to find. Strengthen your visibility, sharpen your strategy and help your videos reach the audiences already searching for them with our Social Search Optimization Strategy workbook ."

    "title": "15 LinkedIn post ideas for Australian brands",
    "date": "2025-12-16T14:00:52+00:00",
    "content": "With over 15 million Australian users , LinkedIn has become a go-to platform for businesses looking to grow their presence, start conversations and engage decision-makers.\nBut success on LinkedIn isn’t about posting often. It’s about sharing the right types of social media content that drives engagement and helps you reach your marketing goals.\nIn this guide, you’ll find 15 strategic post ideas tailored to Australian brands, plus examples and hooks to keep your content consistent, relevant and human.\nCreating content on LinkedIn isn’t just for major enterprises or corporate giants. It’s a powerful marketing tool for B2B companies, startups, government agencies and lifestyle brands alike.\nLinkedIn is where Australians go to learn, research, connect and make business decisions. With content like long-form posts and local case studies, LinkedIn helps your brand show up with purpose, clarity and credibility. Here’s why it matters.\nUnlike on more casual networks, LinkedIn users aren’t just scrolling passively. They’re here to learn, connect and engage with valuable content.\nAustralians, for example, use the platform to research vendors, check up on employers and explore industry ideas. When your posts meet those needs, engagement increases. And that engagement often translates into positive business outcomes like website traffic, demo requests or deeper brand consideration.\nIn high-trust industries like finance, education and energy, brand transparency isn’t optional; it’s expected. LinkedIn helps you build that trust by sharing local insights, founder stories and employee perspectives that humanise your brand.\nThat trust matters because the people making high-value decisions are already on the platform. There are 10 million C-suite executives active on LinkedIn , and every thoughtful post is a chance to earn their attention and confidence.\nTrust also drives brand authority. Publishing consistent thought leadership content positions your business as a credible voice in your field. And the payoff is real: 73% of B2B decision-makers use thought leadership to evaluate a brand’s credibility. Even better, 9 in 10 say they’re more open to sales outreach if the company is known for quality content.\nNo one responds to stiff, overly corporate comms—especially in Australia. LinkedIn gives brands the space to connect with their audience through honest, human storytelling.\nFor example, you could share a behind-the-scenes video from your Melbourne HQ or a shoutout to a regional partner. This type of content builds trust and engagement, and often outperforms generic posts.\nLinkedIn is where job seekers go to size up your culture before they ever hit “apply.”\nHighlight your people, perks and pathways to show what it’s really like to work with you and why top talent should choose you over a competitor. With your content and job listings in one place, your employer brand becomes a competitive advantage on LinkedIn.\nYour audience expects more than just product promotions. They want to see what you stand for. In fact, 88% of Australians dislike it when brands don’t align with their needs and values.\nUse your LinkedIn presence to highlight your impact. That could mean showcasing climate commitments, sharing staff volunteer stories or celebrating local partnerships.\nThis helps you build brand trust and show your community that their priorities are yours too.\nThe LinkedIn algorithm works differently from other networks. It prioritises meaningful engagement through thoughtful comments, shared posts and personal insights.\nThat means posting the same trending videos you’d share on TikTok won’t move the needle here (though engaging media still matters). Beyond following LinkedIn best practices , focus on consistent, high-quality content that resonates with your audience and strengthens your brand presence over time.\nBelow are 15 post ideas tailored for Australian brands. Each one includes a tip to help localise your message and maximise impact.\nWhen your goal is to drive leads and build authority, your content needs to do the heavy lifting. These post ideas help position your company as the definitive solution, turning your LinkedIn page from a simple profile into a powerful, high-intent conversion tool.\nTie your launch to something uniquely Australian, such as a local pain point, seasonal moment or cultural cue. This is the perfect time to lean into video content and try something creative.\nLaunching a sunscreen brand? Frame it around summer road trips and beach days.\nLaunching a fintech platform? Speak to the challenges of managing tax as a sole trader as EOFY approaches.\nLaunching a legal firm? Highlight recent legal and regulatory updates that are relevant to your region or audience.\nHit a growth milestone? Land a government grant? Launch your first pop-up at Westfield? Share it.\nAustralians love to support homegrown success, so don’t just share on your LinkedIn business page . Tag collaborators, investors and team members to boost reach and drive more visits to your profile.\nDon’t just report on industry news—analyse it. Your audience follows you for your unique perspective, not for headlines they find elsewhere. Here are some ways to spin industry news into engaging LinkedIn content.\nUse LinkedIn to position your brand as a trusted voice by sharing insights that matter to Australian professionals.\nTailor content to your industry, such as new energy regulations, shifts in education policies or emerging tech trends in Melbourne’s startup scene. If your business runs a podcast, share recent episodes alongside short summaries to help followers quickly grasp the value.\nAustralian audiences appreciate clear, actionable advice that helps them navigate local challenges. Regularly sharing these updates builds authority and encourages engagement from decision-makers in your space.\nWhether you’re sponsoring SXSW Sydney, attending a Creative Mornings event or hosting your own panel in Brisbane, let your network know.\nAdd context around what the event means to your team or industry. Tag organisers, speakers or other attendees to increase reach and boost your LinkedIn SEO .\nSocial media events are a goldmine for LinkedIn content. Whether you are presenting or attending, conferences are bursting with professional insights. Use them to your advantage: If you’re speaking, share your presentation highlights; if you’re attending, post your takeaways on the latest industry trends.\nShare key takeaways to position your brand as engaged, informed and active in the local scene.\nYour brand is more than its products. It’s the people behind the logo and the community you serve. Culture-driven posts like these pull back the curtain, spotlight your team and transform passive followers into a loyal, engaged community.\nInvite your audience into the conversation with a poll or open-ended question. Keep prompts culturally relevant—for example: “Should Aussie businesses do more to support working parents?”\nYou can also ask for feedback on your products or services, creating a two-way dialogue. It’s a simple way to boost engagement while showing your audience you value their voice.\nPull back the curtain. Whether it’s a workspace tour, team lunch or event prep, behind-the-scenes (BTS) content humanises your brand and brings followers into your world.\nEven casual smartphone footage of your morning standup or a cameo from the office dog can make your team more relatable.\nSpotlight staff, whether they’re city-based marketers or regional logistics leads. Share their career journeys, personal achievements or community impact.\nAustralian audiences value people-first storytelling. They want to see the humans behind the brand, and research shows consumers expect personalised content from businesses on social media.\nAudiences today buy according to their values, which means posting about your mission and commitments can become a core differentiator. These types of LinkedIn posts state clearly what you stand for and build unbreakable trust with people who share your vision.\nRecognise cultural moments like NAIDOC Week, Anzac Day, Lunar New Year or Harmony Day. These posts show cultural awareness and community care, something 91% of Australians expect from brands on social media.\nRemember to aim for thoughtful, inclusive posts, not token gestures. Audiences can tell when a post lacks sincerity, so focus on genuine participation and storytelling that shows your values in action.\nGot great feedback from a local customer? Share it—especially if it includes a photo or video.\nTestimonials build trust, and they’re even more powerful when your audience can recognise the community or client. Tag the customer (with permission) to encourage reshares and increase visibility. You can also expand testimonials into long-form content like newsletters or in-depth case studies.\nTeach your target audience something useful. Tips and how-to posts are highly shareable and show you understand your market.\nFor example, an accounting firm might share “3 tips for EOFY reporting,” while a cybersecurity consultant might post “What Australian SMBs need to know about data privacy.”\nUse a visual like a checklist, quick explainer or LinkedIn carousel to increase engagement. Sharing practical advice positions your brand as knowledgeable, helpful and worth following.\nYour LinkedIn page is a critical tool for your employer brand. It’s where you prove your company makes a tangible impact and where top Australian talent vets their next career move. Here’s how to showcase your wins and attract high-quality candidates who want to join your success story.\nDid your team participate in Clean Up Australia Day? Or did you launch a local mentorship program? Share the story and the impact.\nAustralians love to see brands give back, and this type of content reinforces your values and community ties. Posts that include team photos or action shots tend to perform especially well.\nInstead of posting a generic “we’re hiring,” show what makes your opportunity unique. For example: “We’re looking for a designer to join our Byron Bay office. Ocean dips encouraged.”\nHighlight benefits that speak to the Australian lifestyle, like flexibility, location or team culture. These posts help attract the best talent and build long-term awareness on LinkedIn.\nTimely posts about public holidays or major industry events show your brand is agile and present. These types of posts also help your brand join the moments that matter most to your audience in an authentic way.\nReact to breaking news, industry changes or trending topics with an Australian lens.\nFor example: “What the latest RBA rate hike means for first-time buyers” or “How changing visa rules affect international students.”\nTimely, thoughtful content helps your brand stay relevant and top of mind when it matters most.\nIf customers tag your brand, repost it—especially when it reflects actual Australian experiences. That could be someone using your skincare at Bondi or a tradie showing off your product on site.\nThis kind of social proof adds authenticity. Always credit the original creator and add a caption that connects the post to your brand values.\nUse LinkedIn Live or a comment thread to answer common questions. To boost reach, collaborate with a well-known Australian voice in your industry.\nLive formats encourage interaction, showcase expertise and help build trust with your audience and customers.\nMarketing on LinkedIn performs best when your content is consistent, culturally relevant and built for your local audience.\nThese LinkedIn post ideas are designed to help Australian brands start conversations, build trust and reach the right people without sounding stiff or overly corporate.\nSprout Social makes it easier to plan, write, schedule and analyse your LinkedIn content all in one place.

    "title": "HubSpot vs Sellsy : comparatif des fonctionnalités, avantages et tarifs",
    "date": "2025-12-16T13:22:30+00:00",
    "content": "En tant que professionnel, vous n’avez pas d’autre choix que de vous tourner vers un CRM pour faire avancer votre entreprise. Parmi les différentes solutions présentes sur le marché, il y en a notamment deux que tout semble opposer : HubSpot et Sellsy.\nEt si certains peuvent avoir des idées reçues sur le mode de fonctionnement de chacune de ces solutions, il est fort probable que vous n’ayez pas conscience de leur réel potentiel. Afin de vous aider à y voir plus clair et à choisir entre Sellsy et HubSpot, nous avons décidé de comparer les deux solutions sur leurs fonctionnalités, leurs avantages, et leurs tarifs.\nComparer HubSpot et Sellsy revient à examiner deux visions très différentes du CRM, deux façons d’accompagner les équipes commerciales, marketing et service client, et deux approches de la croissance.\nD’un côté, HubSpot développe une plateforme internationale, modulaire et pensée pour l’inbound marketing. De l’autre côté, on retrouve Sellsy qui propose une solution « made in France » centrée sur la gestion commerciale, la facturation et la simplicité d’usage.\nBien évidemment, si les deux outils partagent des bases communes, ils ne visent pas les mêmes priorités. Pour une entreprise française qui est à la recherche d’un CRM durable, le choix peut sembler délicat.\nAu delà du comparatif suivant qui met en avant les points forts et les points faibles de ces solutions, n’hésitez pas à créer un compte gratuit sur HubSpot pour vous faire votre propre avis, la plateforme ayant un très large éventail de fonctionnalités.\nParmi les deux solutions, l’une d’entre elles apparaît déjà comme bien plus complète. En effet, HubSpot évolue dans un écosystème complet qui peut concerner aussi bien le marketing, que les ventes, le service client et les opérations dans un seul et même environnement.\nSellsy adopte une logique plutôt orientée autour de la gestion commerciale, et avec un ancrage français affirmé. Les données d’adoption témoignent de cette différence d’envergure, avec plus de 278 000 utilisateurs pour HubSpot contre 37 000 entreprises pour Sellsy .\nVoici un tableau comparatif général qui reprend les éléments clés des deux solutions :\nCette première vue synthétique permet de mettre en lumière deux orientations distinctes , avec une plateforme globale et modulaire pour HubSpot, et une solution plus spécialisée pour Sellsy.\nHubSpot conserve une avance sur la majorité des segments de marché avec son CRM tout-en-un, si bien que 83% des clients HubSpot en sont satisfaits sur ce point, et que 79% observent une meilleure qualité de leads .\nHubSpot fonctionne par « Hubs » (le Marketing Hub, le Sales Hub, le Service Hub, le Data Hub et le Content Hub) qui peuvent être activés à la demande. Cette architecture en fait un outil évolutif pour les startups comme pour les grandes entreprises. Le CRM gratuit, quant à lui, sert de base pour gérer les contacts, les deals et le pipeline sans frais.\nHubSpot s’illustre aussi par son vaste catalogue d’intégrations, où les plus de 2000 applications facilitent l’interopérabilité avec les outils que vous utilisez déjà dans d’autres domaines, pour faciliter l’adoption de l’outil.\nParmi les points forts, le Sales Hub propose un pipeline visuel, avec un scoring des leads, la planification des rendez-vous, la gestion des devis, l’automatisation des relances, et des rapports prévisionnels.\nLe Marketing Hub , quant à lui, permet de créer des campagnes multicanales, de segmenter les audiences, d’envoyer des e-mails personnalisés, d’intégrer les réseaux sociaux, et de mesurer précisément les performances de vos actions.\nAvec le Content Hub , les équipes éditoriales peuvent même accéder à des outils dédiés au pilotage des contenus, qu’il s’agisse de la création, de la diffusion et de l’optimisation de ces derniers. Dans un rapport, HubSpot affirme que les entreprises clientes génèrent en moyenne 29% de ventes supplémentaires après 12 mois .\nSellsy se démarque par son orientation très pratique, en se concentrant sur les devis, les factures, les paiements, le tout dans un CRM avec une interface simple.\nParmi les points forts de Sellsy, on peut noter la gestion commerciale qui permet de créer des devis, des factures, et des relances en quelques clics. La partie CRM , avec les fiches de contacts, le suivi des interactions, et l’organisation du pipeline, convient aussi très bien aux petites équipes.\nDu côté de sa solution d’emailing , Sellsy est davantage adapté pour les campagnes « simples », sans segmentation fine de vos contacts. Pour accompagner le service client, le système de gestion des tickets intégré permet aux équipes de réagir dans la même interface que les commerciaux, même si son usage peut être chronophage.\nEnfin, les chefs de projet pourront se tourner vers les outils de gestion de projet intégrés, avec la création et le suivi de tâches et le suivi d’avancement, même si cette partie est moins évoluée sur Sellsy.\nDans l’ensemble, Sellsy propose un périmètre resserré mais cohérent , pensé d’abord pour répondre aux besoins administratifs et commerciaux d’une PME.\nSi les deux solutions sont riches en fonctionnalités, si bien que certains utilisateurs peuvent avoir des difficultés à comprendre et utiliser l’étendue de Sellsy et HubSpot, ce tableau comparatif vous aidera à comprendre ce qu’il est possible ou non de réaliser en les utilisant :\nCe comparatif montre que les fonctionnalités de HubSpot sont bien plus complètes , ce qui explique notamment pourquoi des PME comme de grands groupes se tournent vers ce CRM.\nLes fonctionnalités de Sellsy conviendront davantage aux PME qui ont un besoin très ciblé, notamment pour accompagner leurs commerciaux, et qui ne sont pas à la recherche d’une solution scalable dans le temps.\nToutefois, si vous hésitez entre HubSpot et Sellsy, les deux solutions proposant une version de démonstration, n’hésitez pas à créer un compte !\nHubSpot et Sellsy fonctionnent avec une tarification très différente qui les rend difficilement comparables, mais en analysant chacun des modèles, vous pourrez faire un choix plus éclairé pour votre CRM :\nHubSpot propose un CRM gratuit , sans limite de durée ni contrainte étrangère au volume de contacts commerciaux. Les Hubs payants démarrent dès 9 € par mois , ce qui permet aux entreprises qui le souhaitent d’ajouter progressivement les briques dont elles ont besoin.\nLes tarifs augmentent notamment en fonction du périmètre fonctionnel et du volume de contacts, avec une structure flexible pour accompagner la montée en puissance de votre organisation.\nA l’inverse de HubSpot, Sellsy propose plutôt une gamme articulée autour de trois plans : Standard , Evolution , et Elite avec des prix par utilisateur.\nCette structure de tarifs convient surtout aux entreprises avec des équipes réduites, mais elle peut devenir plus coûteuse pour des équipes commerciales nombreuses et en fonction des outils utilisés.\nSi les deux solutions ont aujourd’hui prouvé qu’elles étaient d’une grande qualité, leur utilisation s’applique surtout dans des cas d’usage précis.\nD’après nos observations, Sellsy est plus adapté si vous gérez une TPE ou PME et que vous souhaitez vous concentrer sur la facturation, le devis et le pilotage commercial , et que vous n’avez pas besoin d’outils de marketing automation évolués. L’interface est simple d’utilisation, l’outil est adapté au marché français, et l’interface facile à prendre en main couplée au support en français sont de véritables points forts.\nEn revanche, vous avez tout intérêt à privilégier HubSpot si vous souhaitez mettre en place un CRM pour structurer l’ensemble de vos processus commerciaux, même avec la version gratuite au départ pour une montée progressive. HubSpot est aussi une solution à privilégier si vous visez un modèle de croissance basé sur l’ inbound marketing , que vous voulez aligner le marketing, les ventes, votre service client et vos opérations dans un seul et même environnement. Si vous avez également besoin d’automatisations puissantes, d’une segmentation approfondie de votre base de clients et d’intégrer des outils externes, HubSpot semble aussi plus adapté à votre situation.\nDans les deux cas, si vous doutez entre HubSpot et Sellsy, les deux solutions proposant une version de démo (et une version gratuite dans le cas de HubSpot), n’hésitez pas à les tester !"

    "content": "Technology has made it easier to move faster, especially with the surge of AI-powered tools promising near-magical results. But choosing the right solution for a specific task or campaign — particularly a marketing automation platform — has never been more complicated.\nThere are thousands of tools on the market, many offering overlapping capabilities and similar feature sets. On the surface, most appear powerful and well equipped. Look closer, and problems quickly emerge — many of which have little to do with the technology itself.\nAn overemphasis on platform capabilities often removes two equally critical elements from the decision — people and process. Before evaluating features or vendors, there is a more fundamental question to answer: where and how should the process begin?\nThe selection process should begin with a clear set of requirements. The marketer leading the evaluation must answer a series of difficult but necessary questions:\nThis list is far from exhaustive. Depending on the size and complexity of the organization, it can easily expand to dozens of questions, many of them difficult to resolve. But without clear answers, it is impossible to define what success looks like.\nOnly after those requirements are documented does platform evaluation make sense. In a recent project, more than 100 marketing automation platforms were reviewed. Based on the client’s requirements, that list was narrowed to about 20. That is where the real work began.\nAlthough the 20 shortlisted platforms sat in a similar price range and appeared to offer comparable feature sets, they differed in meaningful ways. Interface design, feature deployment and — most importantly — integration capabilities varied widely.\nIntegration is often where marketers first encounter the true scope of a marketing automation rollout. This is not about connecting to other marketing tools like Google Ads, Google Analytics or Meta Ads. The real challenge lies in integrating with internal systems used by other departments — sales, logistics and customer support.\nMost platforms offer APIs, which work well if the organization’s broader IT environment is equally modern. In practice, that is rarely the case. Evaluating a platform means understanding every available integration option and how it connects to existing internal applications.\nConsider ecommerce. Nearly all ecommerce businesses rely on marketing automation to deliver transactional and nurturing emails. To support advanced tactics like customer segmentation, the platform must either include a capable CRM or integrate cleanly with an external one.\nLower-cost automation platforms often provide only basic CRM functionality. As the business grows, those limitations become restrictive, forcing a move to an external CRM or custom line-of-business system. That is where integration challenges, implementation timelines and budget impact begin to compound — often reshaping the final platform decision.\nDig deeper: Marketing automation vs. email delivery platform: Which tool is right for your team?\nMarketing does not operate in isolation. To drive business impact, it must work in close coordination with the rest of the organization. That is why implementing a marketing automation platform — one that affects multiple departments — is often a complex, long-term effort that requires a clear understanding of related business processes and data structures.\nMarketing teams may know how to execute email nurturing programs or seasonal campaigns. But when customer interactions depend on real-time pricing, inventory, or fulfillment data, poorly integrated processes quickly break down.\nDocumented processes matter. Having workflows clearly defined — in writing — makes it possible to understand how a new platform depends on systems used by other departments or even external partners.\nThis approach may feel outdated. Many organizations founded in the last decade lack formal process documentation, let alone detailed flowcharts or stakeholder maps. That does not change a basic reality: you cannot optimize or automate a process you do not fully understand.\nThis does not mean automation must wait until every process is documented. It does mean two things are likely. You will not unlock the full value of the platform, and you will encounter increasing friction as the business grows and requirements become more complex.\nAfter assessing the technical and procedural challenges of marketing automation, the most critical factor remains the same — people.\nNo level of technological sophistication can compensate for a lack of internal adoption. If teams are not prepared to use the platform effectively, the investment will fail to deliver value.\nMarketing and business leaders must clearly communicate how the platform will be used and why it matters. That communication must extend beyond marketing. Automation frequently affects sales, operations and customer support, and those teams need visibility into what is changing and how it impacts their workflows. Without alignment, resistance is inevitable — and escalations to leadership often follow.\nPeople considerations also extend to cost. Many martech platforms are licensed per user. In smaller organizations, this may appear manageable. As the company grows and access expands beyond marketing, licensing costs can quickly become a significant component of overall personnel expenses.\nBefore making a final selection, leaders should model licensing costs based on expected growth, future feature needs and the number of users across departments. If adoption expands to sales or support, those costs can exceed initial expectations and strain budgets.\nDig deeper: Is your martech evaluation process still stuck in a pre-AI world?\nSelecting a marketing automation platform based solely on feature lists, without accounting for people, process and integration realities, almost guarantees a suboptimal outcome.\nThe work required may feel excessive. It involves tradeoffs, organizational judgment and difficult decisions — areas where AI can support analysis but cannot replace accountability. Delegating that responsibility to a tool, rather than owning it as a leader, introduces real risk.\nA poor platform decision does more than waste budget. It can stall execution, strain internal relationships and damage credibility — costs few marketers can afford in a competitive job market."
