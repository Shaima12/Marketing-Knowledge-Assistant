Marketing arbitrage dies; product truth wins.\nAgentic commerce acts as a “great filter,” so to speak, for marketing arbitrage, transforming organic search from a source of cheap traffic into the mandatory gatekeeper of AI verification.\nThe signal is already visible in the noise. During the 2025 holiday season, AI agents powered 20% of retail sales . Even allowing for loose definitions, the era of agentic commerce has arrived.\nAll major LLMs now offer direct checkout and new commerce protocols:\nThe infrastructure question is settled, but the strategic question remains: How do you compete when users don’t need to click through to websites to buy?\nThe phrasing “agentic commerce” sets the wrong expectation. Autonomous purchasing, where you give an agent a credit card and monthly allowance to buy on your behalf, is not becoming a reality in the near future.\n“Conversational commerce” is a better frame. Instead of 100% automating the act of buying, LLMs compress the funnel by offering far superior research to classic search engines and showing products in the user interface.\nThe new commerce protocols allow AI agents to directly plug into the backend of your business, instead of crawling your site to show them in a list of search results. Protocols make commerce “headless” and decouple the front from the back-end:\nThe shift from crawling to protocols collapses the legacy 14-click funnel (search, browse, click, checkout) into just two interactions: (1) the model parses intent by matching expert reviews against real-time inventory, and (2) the user executes a single click to buy using stored credentials.\nWhile both protocols, ACP and UCP, enable the same user experience, they offer vastly different terms for the merchant.\nThe shift from search to conversation creates a distinct set of winners, losers, and strategic dilemmas.\nMerchants face a tradeoff between distribution and control.\nAmazon dominates on price and speed, but faces a business model conflict.\nWe are moving from a world of infinite shelf space (10 blue links, endless pagination) to a world of constrained shelf space (three recommendation slots in an AI response).\nIn this environment, SEO shifts from optimizing for clicks to optimizing for ingestion . The goal isn’t to get a human to visit your landing page; it’s to get your product data into the agent’s context window with enough authority that it recommends you.\nThe New “Technical SEO”: Feed quality in the legacy model meant site speed, mobile responsiveness, and Core Web Vitals. In the protocol era, technical SEO is feed integrity. Agents don’t “browse” your site; they query your API. Your website becomes less of a visual destination and more of a structured database. The winners will be merchants who treat their product feed as their primary storefront.\nThe New “On-Page SEO”: Legacy SEO often rewarded articles that simply summarized what everyone else was already saying to rank for broad keywords. LLMs, however, are trained on that consensus. To be cited now, you must provide Information Gain , the delta between what the model already knows and the unique value you provide on top of the consensus.\nThe New “Off-Page SEO”: Backlinks still matter, but their function changes. Instead of passing “link juice” for ranking, they now serve as verification sources for reputation synthesis, together with reviews and web mentions.\nThe last decade allowed white-label brands to arbitrage their way to growth via ads, but agentic commerce acts as the quality filter for this model. While humans are swayed by slick branding, LLMs are dispassionate readers of data that will not recommend a “premium” product when the specs prove it is identical to a generic alternative.\nThe shift to protocols creates a paradox: Models understand long-tail intent perfectly but fulfill it with fat head inventory.\nThe only force that overrides this bias is granular data. Your merchant feed acts as the Claim, but RAG acts as the Trust Layer to verify it.\nIf you expose data points the giants ignore (e.g., exact sourcing, chemical analysis), the model’s reasoning engine must select you to fulfill the constraint, but only if you rank on page 1 to be fetched.\nOrganic search is no longer about the click; it is the prerequisite for agentic verification."
