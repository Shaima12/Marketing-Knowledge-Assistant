Subscribe for free !\nEvery year, after the winter holidays, I spend a few days ramping up by gathering the context from last year and reminding myself of where my clients are at. I want to use the opportunity to share my understanding of where we are with AI Search, so you can quickly get back into the swing of things.\nAs a reminder, the vibe around ChatGPT turned a bit sour at the end of 2025:\nMost of all, we still don’t know the value of a mention in an AI response. However, the topic of AI and LLMs couldn’t be more important because the Google user experience is turning from a list of results to a definitive answer.\nA big “thank you” to Dan Petrovic and Andrea Volpini for reviewing my draft and adding meaningful concepts.\nOptimizing for AI search visibility follows a pipeline similar to the classic “crawl, index, rank” for search engines:\nBefore any content enters the model’s consideration (grounding) set, it must be crawled, indexed, and fetchable within milliseconds during real-time search.\n“ The Attribution Crisis in LLM Search Results ” (Strauss et al., 2025) reports low citation rates even when models access relevant sources.\nModels can only cite sources that enter the context window. Pre-training mentions often go unattributed . Live retrieval adds a URL, which enables attribution.\nTrust is critical because we’re dealing with a single answer in AI search, not a list of search results. Optimizing for trust is similar to optimizing for click-through rates in classic search, just that it takes longer and is harder to measure.\nSearch is moving from abundance to synthesis. For two decades, Google’s ranked list gave users a choice. AI search delivers a single answer that compresses multiple sources into one definitive response.\nThe strategic imperative is identical: earn visibility in the interface where users search. Traditional SEO remains foundational, but AI visibility demands different content strategies:\nBrands that build systematic optimization programs now will compound advantages as LLM traffic scales. The shift from ranked lists to definitive answers is irreversible."
