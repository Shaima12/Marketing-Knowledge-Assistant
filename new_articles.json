They’re weaving humour into the very fabric of their marketing strategies .\nThis approach isn’t about posting a cheeky meme and hoping it sticks. It’s about understanding the nuances of the British sense of humour—dry wit, self-deprecation and clever wordplay—and using it with intent. Done right, it’s a tool that builds loyalty, strengthens relatability and boosts brand equity without crossing the line.\nIf there’s one thing the UK is known for, it’s the unique national sense of humour.  It’s dry,  self-deprecating and, if you haven’t grown up with it, it’s impossible to imitate. It isn’t a surface-level preference. One study even found that the British’ preference for biting satire is genetically encoded .\nLike a secret handshake, using humour signals that you’re part of the club. That you get it . For brands, it’s more than just a tone choice. Using typically British humour effectively comes with measurable brand outcomes like loyalty, advocacy and relatability.\nWhen you think of the British sense of humour, most people think of words like:\nThink David Mitchell, Richard Ayoade or Phoebe Waller-Bridge: clever and dry but with a self-deprecation that undercuts any whiff of pretentiousness.\nIt’s a mixture of classic understatement, an anti-earnestness and a sense that things are funnier when stated indirectly.\nThis brand of humour is a cultural staple. You can find it on classic sitcoms, panel TV shows and in pub banter. When brands use it effectively, it’s immediately recognisable and translates to engagement, memorability and ultimately, brand affinity.\nHumour is a powerful driver for human connection. A shared laugh brings us together.\nAccording to Sprout Social’s Index , UK audiences prize relatability as one of the most important things they expect from social media content. It also reveals that 95% of UK social media users expect brands to understand and tap into culture. In other words, culture is how people relate to brands. Since humour is a big part of British culture, it follows that engaging in classic British humour is a great way to be relatable.\nRelatability builds trust and long-term brand loyalty. That’s precisely what you need to drive real business results on social media.\nOne of the top reasons people follow creators on social media is simple: They make them laugh. Brands can do the same.  Brands that want to build a loyal social media following can do so by simply tickling their audience’s funny bone. Humour has staying power. A single clever post can resurface in someone’s mind weeks later, keeping your brand top of mind and building cultural currency.\nHumour drives 43% of social media shares , giving funny content a higher chance of generating organic reach and earned media. Pairing it with Social Listening lets teams track buzz and sentiment shifts and spot when a joke becomes a lasting brand moment.\nIt’s not enough to be funny occasionally,you need to embed humour into your long-term content strategy to be effective. That means focusing on your publishing workflows, analytics and what competitors are doing. In other words, it’s time to start taking humour seriously.\nWhen humour is part of a broader brand voice system, it becomes scalable, measurable and repeatable.\nA single social media meme might be good for a chuckle, but it won’t be enough to grow your audience. Consider creating a content format that you can serialise.\nIf a user comes across a funny Reel and sees that it’s labeled “Part 1”, they’ll have a reason to hit follow (more on this later). Series also ease the pressure of constantly inventing new ideas. When a format becomes a fan favourite, your audience will often tell you exactly what they want to see next.\nStand-up comedians talk about the importance of “reading the room”: knowing which jokes to lean into and which to shy away from based on crowd reaction. This tactic is one that you should adopt, too. Reading the room digitally can be challenging without powerful social media reporting tools .\nFocus on KPIs like sentiment, shares and engagement rate to measure how your humour resonates. Use Sprout’s tagging and campaign tracking features to segment and analyse your humour-driven posts specifically. Then iterate—refine your approach based on what your audience actually responds to, not what you guess they will.\nGreat humour on social media may look spontaneous, but the best results come from a structured approach. By operationalising your humour strategy, you make it scalable, repeatable and easier to refine over time.\nSprout’s workflows make it easy to review each post for tone and brand alignment before it goes live. Social Listening helps surface trending conversations so you can join in at the perfect moment, while Competitor Reports reveal how your content compares across the industry on key metrics.\nWith the right tools in place, you reduce risk, spot opportunities faster and give your team the creative freedom to deliver consistently brilliant content.\nAs powerful as humour can be, it can also go wrong. You need to keep the following tips in mind for effective risk management .\nThis consideration really comes down to knowing your target audience. It is safe to say, avoid politics, religion and the culture war unless you know exactly where your audience stands. If there’s a chance that a joke will split your audience, don’t post it.\nUse analytics tools to uncover your customer demographics. This capability will give you a better gauge of what you can and can’t joke about.  Combined with Listening tools, it will help you analyse sentiment for how customers react to past posts.\nBacked by data, you can then set tone guardrails and clarify what you will and won’t joke about.\nBefore a post goes live, run it through your tone guide to check that it aligns with your brand’s voice and values. Bring in diverse team perspectives—what’s harmless fun to one person may read as insensitive to another. Sprout’s approval workflows let you build a structured review process, ensuring that your team thoroughly tests content before posting.\nPair that with a simple QA checklist so your humour feels intentional, on-brand and audience-first every time.\nJust as a stand-up comedian is attuned to and adjusts their act according to audience reactions, Sprout’s Listening tool empowers you to do the same.\nYou can track sentiment, trending keywords and conversation volume across platforms. If a joke sparks unexpected negativity, you can pivot quickly, adjust messaging or join the conversation to clarify intent. Pair Listening with the Smart Inbox to see direct audience feedback as it happens, and you’ll turn potential missteps into opportunities to show responsiveness and protect brand trust.\nThe best kind of humour feels effortless, but that doesn’t mean it happens by accident.\nTake Rowan Atkinson, for example. Famously, his comedic performances, from Blackadder to Mr. Bean, were painstakingly planned and choreographed. He never improvised, but he had his act so off-pat that it appeared to be off the cuff.\nTaking this amount of care is exactly how you should approach humour in your marketing efforts.\nBehind the scenes, you’ll be using smart tools to fine-tune your comedic content, as well as to test ideas, refine timing and learn what resonates with your audience. Out front, it should feel like classic British wit: sharp, natural, and never try-hard.\nThese examples highlight how UK brands are putting humour to work on social media.\nAldi has clearly done its homework on British humour.\nAldi UK ran a two-part Instagram series featuring a talking carrot giving instructions to a customer through an earpiece. Tasks included bowling a watermelon down the aisle and shaking up fizzy drinks, and Instagrammers went wild for it.\nThe absurdity of a carrot giving a customer instructions feels like it’s taken fresh out of a Monty Python skit. The skit itself, even the music, feels like an episode of Taskmaster.\nBoth of these familiar British comedy staples have deep resonances for UK audiences, and it shows. Just look at the comment section!\nTHIS is a meat alternative brand that leans into absurdist, Monty Python-esque humour. The Insta Reel below features a man with a wearable BBQ offering strangers in the gym THIS products.\nLet’s break down what’s happening here. A wearable BBQ is inherently absurd. Leaning into a caricature of stereotypical masculinity (the man behind the grill) and contrasting it against social perceptions of meat alternatives. The “macho” gym setting pushes the contrast further, subtly skewering social norms around masculinity, vegetarianism and how plant-based alternatives are perceived.\nIt adds up to sharp satire: absurd, self-aware and unmistakably British.\nIf your brand is about challenging social norms, consider what those norms are and create sharp satirical content of your own.\nFounded in 1884, Currys still has customers mistaking the brand for a food business. Rather than rebranding entirely, the electronics store leans into the joke in its Instagram bio.\nThe brand continues that humour throughout its social posts with a quirky, irreverent and quintessentially British tone.\nThis Reel speaks to the brand’s approach to humour. It features a cranky middle-aged man describing Currys’ products using Gen Z slang. It works because it’s familiar. The irritable man is a well-worn archetype in British comedy (think Bernard from Black Books or Mark from Peep Show), tapping into that archetype for funny content is an absolute winner.\nFamiliar tropes like these are precisely what your brand should be tapping into. Consider doing a deep dive into British comedy to develop skits or characters that are familiar and will resonate with your audiences.\nInnocent Drinks have an off-the-wall but endearing style of humour.\nThey have several different series, and one of the most popular is their “day in the life” series for Innocent employees.\nYou may have come across day-in-the-life videos on LinkedIn highlighting hyper-productive blue-chip tech company employees crushing their to-do lists in record time or influencers showing their matcha lattes mornings and Pilates afternoons.\nThe series lampoons this type of content with much more realistic, relatable day-in-the-life content. It features employees stumbling through meeting-packed, unproductive work days.\nThe Reel above shows an IT worker who spends his days “turning things off and on”. One sharp commenter noticed that this is a callback to a joke from The IT Crowd. Again, harkening back to well-known jokes or characters in British culture is a winning formula and one that you can use in your own brand strategy.\nDuolingo is well-known as a brand that leans into humour consistently.\nOn its UK TikTok account, Duolingo blends Gen Z TikTok absurdity with classic absurdity found in British humour. TikTok humour is a tough nut to crack for many brands, and DuolingoUK is using it to interact with the Gen Z market effectively.\nIn this video, they’re leaning into both the “demure” trend and the matcha craze that’s sweeping Gen Z by creating a mock-instructional video on “how to drink matcha in a demure way”. It’s not forcing its brand on the audience, and there’s no link back to language-learning; Duolingo is using humour alone to nurture its audience.\nThe most successful brands don’t treat humour as a throwaway tactic. They weave it into their brand voice, using it to reflect their values, show confidence, and build genuine connections with their audience.\nWhen used thoughtfully, humour does more than spark a laugh—it builds trust, creates advocates, and keeps your brand top of mind. The key is to plan, measure, and refine so your wit works as hard as the rest of your strategy.\nWith Sprout Social, you can plan, publish and measure every punchline—while Listening keeps you in tune with audience sentiment in real time.
