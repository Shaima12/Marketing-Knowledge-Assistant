    "content": "The search industry is entering a transition that many people still treat as a footnote. The systems consumers rely on are changing, and the way information is gathered, summarized, and delivered is changing with them. Yet the public messaging around what businesses should do sounds as familiar as ever. The narrative says the fundamentals are the same. The advice sounds the same. The expectations sound the same. The message is that SEO still covers everything that matters.\nBut the behavior of the consumer says otherwise. The way modern systems retrieve and present information says otherwise. And the incentives of the companies that shape those systems explain why the narrative has not kept up with reality.\nThis is not a story about conflict. It is not about calling out any company or naming any platform. It is about understanding why continuity messaging persists and why businesses cannot afford to take it at face value. The shift from a click-driven model to an answer-driven model is measurable, visible, and documented. The only question is who benefits when the line between SEO and GEO stays blurry, and who loses when it does.\nLet’s start with some data. Certainly not all the data, but some, at least. Bain and Company published research showing that about 80% of consumers who use search now rely on AI-written summaries for at least 40% of their queries. They also found that organic traffic across many categories has fallen by 15-25% because of this shift.\nPew Research analyzed how people behave when AI summaries appear on the results page. Their findings show that people click traditional links in about eight percent of visits when an AI summary is present. When the summary is absent, that number rises to roughly fifteen percent.\nAhrefs published a study showing that when AI summaries appear, the click-through rate of the top organic result drops by about 34%.\nSeer Interactive measured outcomes across thousands of queries and found a 61% decline in organic click-through on informational queries that surfaced an AI summary. Paid click-through dropped by 68% for the same class of queries.\nBrightEdge expanded the picture. They compared outputs across multiple AI answer engines and found that different systems disagree with each other about brand mentions roughly 62% of the time.\nThese sources do not frame the shift as speculation. They show structural change. Consumers click less when AI summaries appear. They rely more on answer layers. They perform fewer traditional searches. And the systems producing those answers do not behave the same way.\nGiven this, why is the message still that nothing significant has changed and that existing SEO practices still cover the full scope of visibility work?\nThe answer lies in incentives. Established platforms rely on a steady stream of aligned content that fits their current systems and supports the development of the answer structures they use today. They need predictability in that supply. If businesses abruptly redirected their focus toward optimizing for environments outside the classic ranking model, the flow of content into traditional indexing systems would change. Telling the world that the best path forward is to keep improving content in the same ways they always have offers stability. It reduces confusion. It keeps expectations manageable. And it slows the need for new measurement frameworks that reveal how much the system has shifted away from click-based visibility.\nAgencies and consultants also benefit when the line stays blurry. If GEO is described as nothing more than SEO with a different label, they can market the same playbooks with fewer operational changes. They do not need to retrain teams in retrieval-based behavior. They do not need to produce new deliverables or learn new data models. They can continue selling the same work, packaged for a new era, without changing the underlying skill set. For many firms, the incentives favor consistency rather than reinvention.\nTool vendors tied to traditional SEO signals benefit from the same continuity. If GEO is framed as the same as SEO, the pressure to rebuild their systems around vector retrieval, chunk inspection, citation tracking, and cross-engine output analysis decreases. Re-architecting tools to support answer era optimization is expensive. Downplaying the distinction buys time.\nNone of these incentives are wrong. They are normal. Every industry reacts this way when a shift threatens the established workflows, revenue models, and expectations. But these incentives explain why the message of continuity persists even when the data shows otherwise.\nSo, where does SEO end and GEO begin? The overlap is real. If your content is thin, outdated, or buried behind inaccessible structures, you will struggle everywhere. Technical fundamentals still matter. Clear writing still matters. Structured data still matters . Authority still matters . These are non-negotiable for both SEO and GEO.\nBut the differences are too large to ignore. SEO focuses on pages and rankings. GEO focuses on fragments and retrieval. SEO aims to earn the click. GEO aims to earn presence inside the answer the consumer sees. SEO tracks impressions and click-through. GEO tracks citations, mentions, and answer share. SEO studies snippets. GEO studies how different systems pull, blend, and frame information. SEO treats the page as the unit of value. GEO treats the block as the unit of value.\nModern answer engines retrieve specific content blocks, synthesize them, and present the result in compressed form. They may cite a source. They may not. They may mention a brand directly. They may not. They may surface a recommendation from a third party that never appears in traditional analytics. They may pull from locations you do not control.\nIn this environment, the mechanics of visibility change. You now need to design content in discrete, self-contained blocks that can be safely lifted and reused. You need to make entity relationships, attributes, and actions machine-readable. You need to track how AI systems present your information across different platforms. You need to understand that retrieval behavior varies across systems and that answers diverge even when content remains the same. You also need metrics that describe visibility on surfaces where no click occurs.\nConsumer behavior reinforces this need. Deloitte found that adoption of generative AI more than doubled year over year, and that 38% of consumers now use it for real tasks rather than experimentation.\nRecent 2025 consumer data shows that many people already rely on generative AI tools to find and understand information, not just to generate content or complete tasks. A nationally representative survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults, conducted in April 2025 and published in June 2025, found that consumers are using AI tools for everyday information needs, including answering questions, explaining topics, and summarizing complex material.\nWhen people ask questions directly and trust the answer they receive, the role of the page shifts. The business still needs pages, but the consumer may never see them. The information is what matters. The structure is what matters. The clarity is what matters. The authority signal is what matters. The ability of the system to retrieve and use your content is what matters.\nAnd humbly, I think we need to move past conversations like “this platform only sends one percent of my traffic, so it’s hard to justify the investment.” That framing assumes traffic is still the primary signal of influence. In an answer-driven environment, that assumption no longer holds. Consumers increasingly get what they need without ever visiting a site, even when that site’s information directly shaped the answer they trusted. A system may never deliver more than single-digit referral traffic, not because it lacks impact, but because consumer behavior has changed. The most meaningful new signals to watch are adoption, frequency of use, and the types of tasks people rely on each system for. Those metrics tell you where influence is forming, even when clicks never happen.\nThis is why businesses cannot treat SEO and GEO as interchangeable. The fundamentals overlap, but the goals do not. SEO helps you win in ranking environments. GEO helps you stay visible in answer environments. SEO prepares your site for discovery. GEO prepares your information for use. SEO earns the visit. GEO earns the recommendation.\nWhen the line between SEO and GEO stays blurry, the incumbents benefit from stability. Agencies benefit from simplicity. Vendors benefit from delayed change. But the businesses relying on visibility lose clarity. They chase rankings that look strong while losing share in the answer layers their customers have a rapidly growing reliance on. They measure success by clicks even as those clicks decline. They optimize pages while the systems shaping decisions optimize information blocks.\nThe shift does not replace SEO. It adds to it. It builds on it. It requires everything SEO already demands, plus new work that reflects how information is retrieved and used in modern systems. Leaders need clear definitions so they can plan effectively. The teams doing the work need clear expectations so they can build the right skills. And executives need accurate metrics so they can make informed decisions. New metrics beyond the scope of established SEO-centric data points we operate with today.\nClarity is the unlock. Not alarm. Not hype. Not denial. Just clarity. The industry is moving toward answer-driven discovery. The companies that understand this will position themselves to win across environments, not just inside a ranking model that served the last decade well. Visibility now lives in multiple layers. The business that adapts to those layers will own its share of attention. The ones that rely on continuity messaging will fall behind without realizing it until the results flatten.\nThe sands are shifting. The work is changing. And the businesses willing to see the difference between SEO and GEO will be the ones ready for the environments consumers have growing trust in. At some point in our near future, I expect platforms to start sharing AI-related data with businesses. We already see the shift beginning with third-party tool providers, as many are leaning into this shift. Now we need the platforms themselves to share their first-party data with us. But until crucial questions around revenue generation, traffic delivery, and decision-making metrics are answered, we’ll be in flux.\nThis post was originally published on Duane Forrester Decodes ."

    "content": "When Emily Epstein shared her perspective on LinkedIn about how “people didn’t stop reading books when encyclopedias came out,” it sparked a conversation about the future of primary sources in an AI-driven world.\nIn this episode, Katie Morton, Editor-in-Chief of Search Engine Journal, and Emily Anne Epstein, Director of Content at Sigma, dig into her post and unpack what AI really means for publishers, content creators, and marketers now that AI tools present shortcuts to knowledge.\nTheir discussion highlights the importance of provenance, the layers involved in online knowledge acquisition, and the need for more transparent editorial standards.\nIf you’re a content creator, this episode can help you gain insight into how to provide value as the competition for attention becomes a competition for trust.\nKatie Morton : Hello, everybody. I’m Katie Morton, Editor-in-Chief of Search Engine Journal, and today I’m sitting down with Emily Anne Epstein, Director of Content at Sigma. Welcome, Emily.\nEmily Ann Epstein : Thanks so much. I’m so excited to be here.\nKatie : Me too. Thanks for chatting with me. So Emily wrote a really excellent post on LinkedIn that caught my attention. Emily, for our audience, would you mind summarizing that post for us?\nEmily : So this should feel both shocking and non-shocking to everybody. But the idea is, people didn’t stop reading books when encyclopedias came out. And this is a response to the hysteria that’s going on with the way AI tools are functioning as summarizing devices for complicated and complex situations. And so the idea is, just because there’s a shortcut now to acquiring knowledge, it doesn’t mean we’re getting rid of the need for primary sources and original sources.\nThese two different types of knowledge acquisition exist together, and they layer on top of one another. You may start your book report with an encyclopedia or ChatGPT search, but what you find there doesn’t matter if you can’t back it up. You can’t just say in a book report, “I heard it in Encarta.” Where did the information come from? I think about the way this is going to transform search: There’s simply going to be layers now.\nMaybe start your search with an AI tool, but you’ll need to finish somewhere else that organizes primary sources, provides deeper analysis, and even shows contradictions that go into creating knowledge.\nBecause a lot of what these synthesized summaries do is present a calm, “impartial” view of reality. But we all know that’s not true. All knowledge is biased in some way because it cannot be “all-containing.”\nKatie : I want to talk about something you mentioned in your LinkedIn post: provenance. What needs to happen, whether culturally, editorially, or socially, for “show me the source material” to become standard in AI-assisted search?\nWith Wikipedia or encyclopedias, ideally, people should still cite the original source, go deeper into the analysis, and be able to say, “Here’s where this information came from.” How do we get there so people aren’t just skimming surface-level summaries and taking them as gospel?\nEmily : First, people need to use these tools, and there needs to be a reckoning with how reliable they are. Thinking about provenance means thinking about knowledge acquisition as triangulation. So, when I was a journalist, you have to balance hearsay, direct quotes, press releases, and social media.\nYou create your story from a variety of sources, so that way, you get something that’s in the middle and can explain multiple truths and realities. That comes from understanding that truth has never been linear, and reality is fracturing.\nWhat AI does, even more advanced than that, is deliver personalized responses. People are prompting their models differently , so we’re all working from different sets of information and getting different answers. Once reality is fractured to that degree, knowing where something comes from – the provenance – becomes essential for context.\nAnd triangulation won’t just be important for journalists; it’s going to be important for everyone because people make decisions based on the information that they receive.\nIf you get bad inputs, you’ll get bad outputs, make bad decisions, and that affects everything from your work to your housing. People will need to triangulate a better version of reality that is more accurate than what they’re getting from the first person or the first tool they asked.\nKatie : So if AI becomes the top layer in how people access information – designed to hold attention within its own ecosystem – what does that mean for content creators and publishers? It feels like they’re creating a commodity that AI then repackages as its own.\nHow do you see that playing out for creators in terms of revenue and visibility?\nEmily : Instead of competing for attention, creators and publishers will compete for trust. That means making editorial standards more transparent. They’re going to have to show the work that they’re doing. Because with most AI tools, you don’t see how they work, it’s a bit of a black box.\nBut if creators can serve as a “blockchain,” (a verifiable ledger of information sources) and they’re showing their sources and methods, that will be their value.\nThink about photography. When it first came out, it was considered a science. People thought photos were pure fact. Then, darkroom techniques like dodging and burning or combining multiple exposures showed that photos could lie.\nAnd when photography became an art form, people realized that the photographer’s role was to provide a filter. That’s where we are with AI. There are filters on every piece of information that we receive.\nAnd those organizations that make their filter transparent are going to be more successful, and people will return to them because again, they’re getting better information. They know where it’s coming from, so they can make better decisions and live better lives.\nEmily: It was a shocking moment in the history of photography. that people could lie with photographs. And that’s sort of where we are right now. Everybody is using AI, and we know there are hallucinations , but we have to understand that we cannot trust this tool, generally speaking, unless it shows its work.\nKatie: And the risks are real. We’re already seeing AI voiceovers and video deepfakes mimicking creators often without their consent.\nKatie : In your post, you ended with “people still doing the work of deciding what’s enough.” In an attention economy of speed and convenience, how do we help people go deeper?\nEmily : The idea that people don’t want to go deeper flies in the face of Wikipedia holes. People start with summarized information, but then click a citation, keep going further, watch another show, keep digging.\nPeople want more of what they want. If you give them a breadcrumb of fascinating information, they’ll want more or that. Knowledge acquisition has an emotional side. It gives you dopamine hits: “I found that, that’s for me.”\nAnd as content marketers, we have to provide that value for people where they say, ‘Wow, I am smarter because of this information. I like this brand because this brand has invested in my intelligence and my betterment.’\nAnd for content creators, that needs to be the gold star.\nKatie : Right on. For those who want to follow your work, where can they find you?\nEmily : I’m dialoging and writing my thoughts on AI out loud and in public on LinkedIn . Come join me, and let’s think out loud together.\nKatie : Sounds great. And I’m always at searchenginejournal.com. Thank you so much, Emily, for taking the time today."

    "content": "Un logiciel qui transforme vraiment vos actions marketing ?\nAvec des points de contact et des opportunités qui ne cessent de se multiplier, l’univers du marketing numérique n’a jamais évolué aussi rapidement. Aujourd’hui, les équipes marketing dans les entreprises sont en permanence à la recherche de solutions pour gérer leurs campagnes , leurs données , leurs automatisations , et leurs statistiques .\nC’est justement pour cette raison qu’une solution comme HubSpot est de plus en plus plébiscitée par les professionnels, cette solution ayant de nombreux atouts au sein de son Marketing Hub…\nDans HubSpot, le Marketing Hub se présente comme une solution qui se veut complète, optimisée par l’intelligence artificielle, et qui a pour objectif d’aider les entreprises à attirer des visiteurs qualifiés , en plus de créer des expériences personnalisées et de convertir plus efficacement .\nEn France, de nombreuses organisations s’appuient d’ores et déjà sur cette approche, si bien que 84% des clients HubSpot rapportent une hausse de leur chiffre d’affaires et 95% observent un retour sur investissement positif, dont 76% en seulement quelques semaines.\nEt parce que les équipes de HubSpot sont aussi convaincues par leur outil, celles-ci vous permettent même de créer un compte gratuit pour réaliser votre propre tour d’horizon détaillé du Marketing Hub, essayer les différents outils disponibles, et créer vos toutes premières campagnes.\nHubSpot positionne le Marketing Hub comme une plateforme dite « unifiée », c’est à dire qui se veut capable d’ orchestrer toutes les étapes du cycle d’acquisition . Dès la première utilisation, on peut voir que HubSpot a souhaité concentrer ses actions sur une seule interface qui permet non seulement de produire des campagnes plus cohérentes, mais aussi d’affiner la qualité des leads générés. D’ailleurs, selon une étude de la plateforme, les utilisateurs qui combinent plusieurs hubs HubSpot enregistrent un taux de clôture cinq fois supérieur .\nParmi les différentes fonctionnalités, le Marketing Hub aide ainsi à attirer une audience qualifiée grâce à des contenus pertinents et des campagnes multicanales, mais aussi à engager les visiteurs à travers des formulaires intelligents avec des boutons dynamiques ou même des chatbots optimisés grâce à l’IA.\nEn complément, le Marketing Hub permet de convertir les prospects grâce au marketing automation, au scoring et à la personnalisation, et d’ analyser précisément le ROI marketing via le reporting et l’attribution des revenus. Cette vision tout-en-un repose sur des briques centrales dans la solution, avec des formulaires , des campagnes , des réseaux sociaux , des workflows … et plus récemment, une couche d’intelligence artificielle intégrée dans chaque étape du travail quotidien.\nDans son Marketing Hub, la plateforme propose de nombreuses fonctionnalités qui permettent de capturer et qualifier les leads, avant de les exploiter par la suite dans votre base de contacts :\nLes formulaires du Marketing Hub ont l’avantage de s’adapter automatiquement au profil de chaque visiteur. Grâce à cette personnalisation pilotée par l’IA, ils détectent les informations déjà connues , ajustent les champs nécessaires et améliorent la qualité des données récoltées . Les soumissions de formulaire sont ensuite immédiatement synchronisées dans le CRM, ce qui permet de faciliter le suivi.\nLes boutons dynamiques, quant à eux, permettent de proposer l’action la plus pertinente en fonction du contexte, comme le téléchargement d’un guide, l’inscription à un webinaire, ou même l’accès à une offre.\nLes segments d’audience de HubSpot identifient les visiteurs anonymes à fort potentiel en fonction de leur comportement et de leur intention sur votre site web, un e-mail, ou sur une landing page.\nIls servent de base pour créer des campagnes ciblées , relancer la navigation ou déclencher des scénarios automatisés selon le besoin.\nEnfin, le Marketing Hub a l’avantage d’inclure depuis peu un agent conversationnel IA qui guide les visiteurs vers le bon contenu , répond aux questions courantes et peut capturer automatiquement des leads chauds .\nMême si cette fonctionnalité est encore très récente, les premiers chiffres sont positifs pour les équipes marketing. Selon les derniers chiffres publics, HubSpot Breeze aurait déjà fait gagner jusqu’à 2,4 heures par semaine aux utilisateurs .\nL’un des grands avantages d’une solution comme HubSpot repose dans le fait de pouvoir orchestrer l’ensemble de vos campagnes sur plusieurs canaux, sans avoir besoin de changer d’outil :\nAu lieu de jongler entre plusieurs plateformes, HubSpot centralise la planification , la publication et l’ analyse des performances .\nLa boîte de réception de l’outil permet de regrouper l’ensemble des commentaires, des messages privés et des différentes interactions pour faciliter la relation avec votre communauté.\nEn quelques clics seulement, HubSpot peut se connecter à Google, Facebook, Instagram et LinkedIn Ads. L’outil assure un suivi complet avec le coût par lead, l’attribution des revenus, et l’automatisation des audiences similaires.\nAinsi, les équipes peuvent repérer précisément les campagnes qui génèrent du chiffre d’affaires , un besoin de premier plan pour 79% des utilisateurs qui constatent une meilleure qualité des leads avec HubSpot.\nPour affiner vos différents contenus sans y consacrer trop de temps, HubSpot permet de tester plusieurs versions d’un e-mail, d’une page ou même d’un bouton.\nUne fois que le test a été lancé et que les utilisateurs y ont été soumis, l’IA sélectionne ensuite la variante gagnante selon des critères que vous avez défini en amont, comme le taux de clics, la conversion, ou l’engagement.\nAu delà de pouvoir intervenir sur les différents canaux selon vos clients et vos objectifs, HubSpot permet aussi de créer , de personnaliser et d’ automatiser un bon nombre d’actions au sein du Marketing Hub :\nPour commencer, le Marketing Studio de HubSpot se présente comme un tableau de bord central et optimisé par l’IA. Il regroupe à la fois la planification , la production de contenus , le suivi des tâches et le lancement des campagnes .\nQue ce soit pour la création, la personnalisation, l’automatisation, ou même les trois à la fois, cette approche permet d’ augmenter la visibilité des équipes et de réduire les silos opérationnels .\nEncore aujourd’hui, les e-mails restent l’un des leviers les plus performants . Et qu’il s’agisse de personnalisation de masse, de segmentation fine, ou de contenus générés ou optimisés par l’IA, les possibilités sont infinies avec un outil comme le Marketing Hub de HubSpot.\nLes dernières études de HubSpot constatent d’ailleurs une hausse rapide de l’engagement grâce à cette fonctionnalité, et même une réduction du temps de clôture des ventes jusqu’à 65% lorsqu’elles sont utilisées conjointement avec le CRM.\nAvec des utilisateurs de plus en plus exigeants, les attentes n’ont jamais été aussi nombreuses. Heureusement, si vous vous tournez vers une solution complète comme HubSpot, la personnalisation va en réalité bien plus loin que de l’insertion de champs dynamiques.\nHubSpot permet d’adapter les pages de votre site web, des sections ou des messages selon la phase du parcours client, son historique de navigation , le type d’entreprise , ou encore les interactions précédentes .\nCette fonctionnalité est d’ailleurs excellente pour amplifier les conversions sur les landing pages .\nL’automatisation des workflows est l’une des autres forces du Marketing Hub. Dans les paramètres, vous pouvez identifier et intervenir facilement sur les relances de contenus , les séquences e-mail de nurturing , la qualification automatique des leads, la mise à jour des données dans votre CRM, et l’ attribution commerciale à la bonne équipe ou à la bonne personne.\nContrairement à ce que l’on pourrait penser, en plus d’apporter davantage de personnalisation, cette automatisation libère du temps opérationnel pour les équipes concernées. Selon HubSpot, 82% des utilisateurs du Sales Hub , qui interagissent directement avec le Marketing Hub, observent une amélioration en moins d’un mois seulement.\nOui, le forfait Starter permet de débuter avec les formulaires, les newsletters, des landing pages et des premières automatisations dans le Marketing Hub.\nL’IA intervient uniquement quand elle peut apporter une plus-value et un gain de temps pour les utilisateurs, comme dans la création de contenus, l’optimisation des e-mails, la segmentation des leads, la cartographie du parcours et les recommandations d’actions à mettre en place.\nOui, la marketplace de HubSpot propose des centaines d’intégrations pour ajouter des réseaux sociaux, des outils publicitaires, des CRM externes si vous n’utilisez pas HubSpot, des solutions de paiement, ou même des CMS.\nHubSpot propose un scoring basé sur les comportements et les données CRM, ajustable selon les critères de votre ICP (Ideal Customer Profile). Le scoring classe automatiquement les contacts selon leur engagement, leurs actions et leur adéquation avec votre ICP. Les commerciaux peuvent ainsi concentrer leur attention sur les leads qui ont réellement des chances de se convertir."

    "content": "Marketing mix models aim to answer the marketer’s billion-dollar question: where should you spend your budget? Yet most organizations build models and still struggle to translate their outputs into decisions anyone feels confident making. The problem isn’t how advanced the model is. It’s how organizations use it and what they feed into it.\nToday’s customer journey is more fragmented, faster-moving and harder to track than ever. Consumers switch between platforms, devices and channels in ways that don’t follow linear paths, and their decisions are shaped by factors far beyond paid media.\nDespite this, many organizations still apply marketing mix modeling (MMM) with a decade-old mindset. Annual refresh cycles, siloed ownership and static inputs like channel-level spend, impressions or GRPs remain common. Some models assume linear, time-invariant effects or rely on last-touch logic, which fails to accurately reflect how customers actually move across channels. These legacy assumptions no longer align with faster, more complex decision cycles.\nFoundational practices still matter when applied thoughtfully. Multi-year data helps establish reliable baselines, and limiting variables supports model stability. But the pace of change in consumer behavior, media and culture means those practices must evolve. New channels, trends, devices and market dynamics constantly reshape how people engage, requiring data that captures emerging channels, real-time behavior and broader market shifts.\nDig deeper: What your attribution model isn’t telling you\nMMM must reflect that complexity. It needs broader inputs, more frequent refreshes and an operating model designed to guide decisions as conditions change. The challenge, however, is not the technology itself. The real gap lies in how organizations approach MMM. Too often, models are used to validate past decisions rather than guide future ones. Making MMM effective requires cross-functional ownership, better data access, faster feedback loops and a mindset that treats measurement as a continuous, decision-driving capability.\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau’s “Modernizing MMM: Best Practices for Marketers” provides a practical blueprint for doing exactly that, focusing less on modeling theory and more on the impact of decisions.\nIf your MMM still runs on annual cycles and is only based on campaign performance, you’re already behind. IAB highlights three principles that separate leaders from those that are still relying on outdated methods.\nDig deeper: Why MMM makes marketers nervous — and why you should use it anyway\nThe complexity of the customer journey and the need for real-time responsiveness demand more than model refreshes. They require an operational shift. The IAB guide outlines six best-practice areas that help build MMM into a truly modern, business-driving function.\nMost organizations don’t need real-time models to start making progress. Clean data, a clear objective and one successful pilot that drives a real decision are enough to move past the fundamentals. Tools and dashboards exist, but without organizational commitment and adoption, they deliver no value.\nProgress requires more than budget — it necessitates cultural alignment and a commitment to action-based insights.\nStrong measurement isn’t about chasing perfection. It’s about enabling smarter, faster decisions and having the confidence to know what to do next.\nDig deeper: The smarter approach to marketing measurement\nMarketers are under increasing pressure. Data changes are shrinking visibility. Platforms evolve quickly. New channels and behaviors outpace legacy models. CFOs want more clarity on marketing’s impact.\nMMM is not a luxury — it is mission-critical business infrastructure. Organizations that fail to modernize risk:\nThe question isn’t whether your MMM technology is current. It’s whether your organization is structured to act on what it tells you. If your MMM isn’t informing decisions, it’s time to rethink your approach.\nDig deeper: Unlocking the power of marketing mix modeling solutions"
