    "title": "Rethinking marketing creativity in compliance-heavy industries",
    "date": "2025-12-05T14:12:00+00:00",
    "content": "Many industries benefit greatly from strategic marketing yet are often held back by regulatory or compliance requirements. Financial services, healthcare, legal, insurance, engineering, energy and environmental management, cybersecurity and similar sectors are often viewed as dry, overly stoic or difficult places to employ creative tactics — though that isn’t true at all. Before teams can unlock creativity, they must understand the constraints that shape how marketing works in these environments.\nRegulated industries face challenges that can halt momentum, delay campaigns and limit what marketers can say. These include slow review cycles, strict rules around claims and disclosures and limitations on the types of content teams can publish.\nMarketing moves fast, but legal teams in financial services, healthcare, energy or legal sectors often take days or weeks to review content. This kills momentum, delays campaigns and makes real-time engagement nearly impossible. Creating and implementing a clear operating model and compliance workflow can streamline the process.\nDig deeper: Data-driven content: The key to connecting with healthcare consumers\nEven with a streamlined workflow, marketers in regulated industries operate under strict content boundaries. Knowing what you can and can’t say is essential to keeping campaigns compliant and avoiding unnecessary rework. These restrictions generally fall into six categories.\nUnsubstantiated or unsupported claims : You can’t make claims without evidence, disclaimers or regulator-approved language. Examples:\nThe reason is that, generally speaking, regulators require evidence, disclaimers and often pre-approved language\nImplying outcomes you cannot control : Industries like financial services, legal, healthcare and insurance prohibit promises about results. Examples:\nThis is considered deceptive or misleading, even if phrased casually.\nTestimonials that imply results : Testimonials cannot overstate typical outcomes or guarantee results. Examples:\nTestimonials cannot promise or imply typicality or guaranteed results\nDig deeper: Why compliance can’t be an afterthought in the AI age\nMissing or incomplete disclosures : Required disclosures must be present and accurate. Examples include:\nForward-looking statements without disclaimers : Include proper disclaimers when describing future expectations. Examples:\nRequired: A forward-looking statements disclaimer and relevant risk disclosures.\nEducational content that crosses into advice : You cannot give prescriptive guidance that would normally require a licensed professional. Examples:\nAI introduces an added layer of complexity to an already challenging compliance environment. Using AI tools isn’t a compliance issue on its own, but AI doesn’t always get things right. That’s where humans come in — through governance, guardrails and approvals that reduce ethical, legal and reputational risk. AI-generated outputs are only as strong as the information or prompts behind them. Nearly all AI-produced content needs human review and often editing.\nAI governance is essentially a system of checks and balances. It may involve a copywriter or editor, an advisory or legal board or an independent technology that double-checks AI outputs. This process should also include reviewing content for compliance and regulatory adherence.\nMarketing leaders can still be creative and cutting-edge by building structure that supports both speed and compliance.\nTemplates, guidelines and scripts create a win-win — they make it easier to follow compliance rules and they remove friction for contributors who only need to cover the required bullet points.\nTeams should also develop safe word lists and banned word lists. The banned lists can extend beyond specific terms and include broader topics that are off-limits. These tools significantly reduce the chance that campaigns or posts will require major edits or full rewrites after review.\nWhen content relies on thought leaders or subject matter experts, bullet-point scripts make the process much faster. They give SMEs a clear starting point, which makes participation easier and more consistent.\nDig deeper: The stakes around trust, compliance and consent are higher than ever\nMarketing teams should also take advantage of compliance-ready content frameworks that have already been vetted and approved. These frameworks allow regulated teams to regain control and move faster because legal and compliance teams consistently sign off on them.\nThe SAFE claims framework helps marketers keep statements compliant. The steps are simple:\nExample: “Based on data from the American Heart Association, maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise may support cardiovascular health.”\nBeyond compliant claims, marketing teams should archive and repurpose their best non time-sensitive content. When content isn’t tied to specific dates or short-lived practices, it can be re-edited and spun into new formats, lengths or angles with minimal effort.\nBecause compliance review happened on the front end, teams can reuse these assets without concern. Social and digital teams also benefit, as generating new content can be a constant challenge.\nData privacy and first-party data strategies also play a major role. This is especially true for industries that are highly regulated or subject to strict compliance reviews.\nThese conditions require a shift toward tactics like email nurturing and consent-based marketing, which are replacing retargeting and third-party data brokers. Marketers must now operate within rules defined by HIPAA, GLBA, GDPR, CCPA and other industry data-use requirements.\nDig deeper: How brands can turn compliance into a competitive advantage\nImplementing creative marketing strategies in highly regulated environments is challenging — it requires more checks and balances and a more structured process. But that doesn’t mean creativity or spontaneity disappears.\nBy building guidelines, templates and scripts into content creation and baking compliance into the workflow before launch, teams can still produce work that is fresh and creative. Even if the industry feels stuffy at times, your marketing doesn’t have to."

    "content": "When the Content Marketing Institute surveyed marketers last year, content strategy felt stuck in neutral — steady, but uninspired. This year? Marketers are making real moves.\nIn its latest survey, 97% of marketers say they now have a content strategy in place. Among them, 13% report significant gains in performance and ROI, while nearly half (48%) saw modest improvements. Thirty percent say their strategy held steady, and just 9% saw any decline at all.\nThat adds up to 61% reporting improvement — and while tech adoption helped (51% pointed to new tools), the biggest shift wasn’t technical. It was human. Nearly three-quarters (74%) credit strategy refinement, with 40% also pointing to team restructuring and resource changes. Other factors included better measurement (26%), budget shifts (16%), market changes (14%), competitive pressure (13%), and evolving audience behavior (10%).\nContributing authors are invited to create content for MarTech and are chosen for their expertise and contribution to the martech community.
