Who are you writing for? How do you want them to feel when they see your post or read your Instagram caption? What actions do you want them to take?\nHere are a few more tips for creating Instagram captions that resonate.\nA picture might say a thousand words, but your Instagram posts need captions to provide more context. Especially when sharing branded content, you need some copy to fully explain the point you’re trying to convey. The best advice for writing captions on Instagram? Front-loading your captions with valuable information. Instagram cuts off what your users see after a few lines of text, so cover the crucial things first.\nExplain why you’re sharing it and why it’s relevant\nMost importantly, do so in a way that’s concise and to the point. Which brings me to my next tip.\nInstagram captions can be a maximum of 2,200 characters , which is between 310 and 550 words . However, that doesn’t mean every one of your captions should take up that much space.\nIn fact, it’s typically better to create a succinct, quick and easy-to-read caption over a large block of text—except for in rare circumstances when that space is needed to fully flesh out an offering, contest , giveaway or promotion. Sometimes, it might be best to only write a one-word Instagram caption.\nDrafting is just the first step. To truly optimize your strategy, you must test and iterate. Writing, reviewing and editing your content before you publish ensures clarity and impact.\nTake it a step further by A/B testing your captions. Experiment with different phrases, hashtags, calls-to-action and lengths. Use Sprout Social’s Tagging feature to categorize posts by caption style, then analyze the performance in Sprout’s Post Performance Report to definitively see what drives results for your brand.\nEvery brand should have standard brand voice guidelines to follow. This helps your marketing team be consistent, not only in every single Instagram caption but also everywhere else including your tweets, Facebook posts, blog content and email newsletters.\nEven for a business, Instagram is still a fun social media platform, so don’t be afraid to let loose a little. Celebrate your followers’ favorite holidays and seasons . Incorporate emojis. Use a bit of slang. Throw in some popular acronyms (i.e., DM, IRL, IMO, FOMO). Of course, always be sure to use Instagram hashtags .\nRemember, hashtags in your Instagram caption improve your visibility. However, it’s essential to use the correct number of relevant hashtags. Measure the engagement levels of your audience with different amounts of tags to see what your magic number is.\nWhile someone may “like” your photo just because it’s high-quality or well-designed, as a brand you want more. You want a comment, a follow or, best-case scenario, a purchase or signup.\nTo further engage your audience, use your caption strategically. Ask a question or tease a new product or feature using some of the examples we shared above.\nGuide your customers towards activities that drive business impact. Ask them to tag their friends in the comments to increase reach, or direct them to the link in your bio . Sprout Social’s Reports help you track these click-throughs and engagement metrics, proving the ROI of your caption strategy.\nGreat captions are the bridge between your content and your customer’s next action. Don’t let creative fatigue slow your momentum. Sprout Social empowers you to plan, schedule and analyze your Instagram strategy in one intuitive platform. From AI-powered listening insights that reveal what your audience wants to hear, to robust reporting that proves your ROI, Sprout Social gives you the tools to command your market.\nAnd if you want to up your Instagram game, learn more about how your brand can maximize your Instagram efforts."
