Most link building agencies are selling you an outdated playbook from 2015.\nVolume. Guest posting on dead sites. Chasing domain ratings at all costs.\nBut if you’re a marketing leader in 2026, you know the game has changed.\nI’ve spent the last decade completing over 575 link building campaigns and scaling my team at uSERP to 55+ people. I have worked with SaaS giants like monday.com and Robinhood.\nI know first hand that the gap between a bad backlinks agency and a great one is no longer just about rankings. It is about revenue.\nHere’s what I have learned, and how you can use it to pick a skilled link building agency in the AI era.\nTraditional link-building isn’t dead. But the old methods are broken.\nFor years, SEO agencies focused only on domain authority (DA) or domain rating (DR).\nThey built backlinks from any site with a high number of backlinks. They ignored readership and content quality.\nBecause search engines have evolved, links now serve two masters: Google’s algorithm and AI model training data .\nIgnoring this means losing search engine rankings (and watching your bottom line suffer).\nIn fact, uSERP’s 2025 State of Backlinks Report, which surveyed 800 SEO professionals, found that 67.5% believe backlinks influence overall search results (a rise from 2023).\nBut it’s not just quantity. Quality and brand authority work together, month after month, to drive traffic.\nThis data forced us to pivot at uSERP. We stopped chasing vanity metrics like DR.\nInstead, we started prioritizing traffic and relevance.\nIt turns out that a single link from a site that appears in a Perplexity answer is worth more than 10 links from high-DR sites with zero readership.\nAgencies that fail to adapt are dying, and so are their clients.\nHow can you pick a link building agency that catapults your business in this AI era instead of leaving you stranded?\nIt’s easy to promise the world on a sales call. It’s harder to deliver natural links that drive revenue.\nWhen vetting partners, look for these specific green flags.\nThey track brand mentions in LLMs . They understand that a link is a citation. It validates your expertise to both humans and machines.\nAsk them this: “Can you show me examples of clients appearing in AI-generated answers?”\nIf they have a proven system, that’s a green flag. It means they know what they’re doing.\nFor example, we developed proprietary AI visibility tracking tools because we had to. It was the only way to measure impact.\nAny agency you hire must discuss citations and how search engines use links to verify facts.\nContent creation is the backbone of modern link acquisition .\nYou cannot just beg for links anymore. You have to earn them with a content-driven approach.\nThat is why digital PR was the most effective link-building tactic in 2025, according to our State of Backlinks Report.\nThe winning strategy is simple. Produce linkable assets , such as original studies, interactive tools, and expert commentary.\nThese assets generate inbound links naturally. They get cited by AI and compound over time.\nFor example, a SaaS brand might create a salary calculator. Journalists and publishers love this data.\nThis approach also shifts the dynamic from cold outreach to relationship-based link building. Even if you do cold outreach, you should expect better results because it’s a win-win for both parties, and you’re leading with quality content and data they can’t ignore.\nVague promises are red flags. Detailed reporting on publishers, anchor text, and traffic estimates is a green flag.\nFor example, our data show that most SEO professionals spend between $5,000 and $10,000 per month on link building.\nIf someone offers you 100 links for $500, that’s a liability, not a deal.\nThey should also provide a dashboard that includes your link inventory, KPIs, and how your content is driving traffic over time.\nTransparency builds trust. Secrecy usually hides black hat link building tactics.\nLet’s look at red flags you should stay far away from.\nI have worked with 100+ clients who got burned by cheap link building providers . They saw temporary spikes, then got hit by core Google updates.\nThis is the price of buying temporary tactics. It’s the equivalent of shiny object syndrome that wastes time, money, and reputation for the sake of slightly higher initial traffic that evaporates after a couple of months.\nNo agency controls Google. They can influence probabilities, but they cannot guarantee outcomes.\nRanking factors are very complex. Plus, some are unknown, and agencies can only estimate probabilities based on experience and data.\nPBNs (Private Blog Networks) are poison for your site.\nThey’re fake “blogs” that exist for one reason: to pass authority. They violate Google’s rules and go against its spam policies .\nIf your agency is buying links off some “menu” or dropping niche edits on hacked, junk sites, that’s your cue to walk away.\nSure, these backlinks might temporarily boost your domain rating. But sooner or later, your search visibility winds up circling the drain.\nIf they use the same email template for everyone, they are failing.\nJournalists receive dozens of these every day and just ignore or delete them. Website owners mark them as spam.\nSending thousands of generic emails daily reflects poorly on your brand.\nThis is a silent killer. Ahrefs found that 66.5% of links from 2013 to 2024 are now dead.\nYou need a partner who monitors their work. They must check for link rot and take steps to fix it to protect your investment and your brand’s organic growth.\nDon’t just trust a Clutch profile. Grill potential partners with these questions.\nThey should talk about how they verify traffic and how they check for spammy sites. If they’re not even looking at a site’s keyword rankings, that’s a big red flag.\nAsk how they measure AI visibility by impact in ChatGPT or Perplexity.\nYou could have a severe technical issue that, once fixed, could cause a permanent spike in traffic. But that’s a rare exception.\nReal SEO services take time. BuzzStream’s 2025 State of Digital PR Report states that most campaigns deliver results within 3-6 months .\nDomain rating is a vanity metric if it doesn’t lead to revenue. They should track growth in organic search traffic and referral traffic.\nAsk about backlink gap analysis and see if they share a high-level step-by-step of their link building process.\nGiven the high rate of link rot, a replacement policy is essential. You need backlink management that protects your investment.\nDecide if you want digital PR or traditional link building with AI enhancements. But make sure there’s accountability and a process that actively monitors and replaces rotten links.\nLet’s look at a real example. When monday.com reached out to my company, uSERP , they had 100+ internal SEO staff but still needed help with content production and PR.\nThe competitors were winning in organic search, taking over primary keywords, and gaining market share.\nSo, we focused on untapped keywords first. We created helpful content and optimized it to land crucial backlinks from publications like Crunchbase and G2.\nWe focused on quality plus relevance. Then, monday earned volume with the cause-and-effect principle.\nThe result was a 77.84% increase in traffic to 1.2M+ monthly visitors.\nThis is the lens you need: relationship-building techniques that demonstrate real authority and value, resulting in ROI. Not just rankings.\nWhether in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Canada, quality link building like this takes 60-90 days for early signals and 6-12 months for full impact. But the dividends last for years.\nPicking a link building agency in 2026 isn’t about finding the cheapest option. It is about finding partners who understand the AI-first future.\nYou need transparency, AI visibility results, and digital PR expertise.\nAvoid anyone selling the 2015 playbook. The winners focus on citations, AI brand mentions, and revenue growth. Everything else is just noise.\nStart asking the hard questions. Look for the green flags and don’t settle for vanity metrics.\nFor more foundational strategies, check out our complete link building guide .\nFeatured Image: Image by Shutterstock.
