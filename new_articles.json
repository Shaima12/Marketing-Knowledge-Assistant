    "content": "“Build a brand” has become one of the most repeated phrases in SEO over the past year. It is offered as both diagnosis and cure. If traffic is declining, build a brand. If large language models are not citing you, build a brand. If organic performance is unstable, build a brand.\nThe problem is not that this advice is wrong. The problem is that it is incomplete, and for many SEOs, it is not actionable.\nA large proportion of people working in SEO today have developed in an environment that rewarded channel depth rather than marketing breadth. They understand crawling, indexing, content templates, internal linking, and ranking systems extremely well. What they have often not been trained in is how demand is created, how brands are formed in the mind, or how different marketing channels reinforce one another over time.\nSo, when the instruction becomes “ build a brand ,” the obvious question follows. What does that actually mean in practice, and what happens after you say the words?\nSearch has always been a demand capture channel rather than a demand creation channel. SEO does not usually make someone want something they did not already want. It places a brand in front of existing intent and attempts to win preference at the moment of consideration.\nWhat SEO can do very effectively is increase mental availability. By being visible across a wide range of non-branded queries, a website creates repeated brand touchpoints. Over time, those touchpoints can contribute to familiarity, preference, and eventually loyalty.\nThe important part of that sentence is “over time.”\nAffinity and loyalty are not short-term outcomes. They are built through repeated exposure, consistency of messaging, and relevance across different contexts. SEO can support this process, but it cannot compress it. No amount of optimization can turn visibility into trust overnight.\nAI has introduced new technical and behavioral challenges, but it has also created urgency at the executive level. Boards and leadership teams see both risk and opportunity, and the result is pressure. Pressure to act quickly, to be visible in new surfaces, and to avoid being left behind.\nIn reality, this is one of the most significant visibility opportunities since the mass adoption of social media. But like social media, it rewards those who understand distribution, reinforcement, and timing, not just production.\nContent and digital PR are often positioned as the vehicles for brand building in search. That framing is not wrong, but it is frequently too vague to be useful.\nGoogle has been clear, including in recent Search Central discussions, that strong technical foundations still matter. Good SEO is a prerequisite to performance, not a nice-to-have. Content and digital PR sit within that system because they create the signals that justify deeper crawling, more frequent discovery, and sustained visibility. Both content and digital PR can be dissected further based on tactical objectives, but at the core, the objective is the same.\nSearch demand does not appear out of nowhere. It grows when topics are discussed, linked, cited, and repeated across the web. Digital PR contributes to this by placing ideas and assets into wider ecosystems. Content supports it by giving those ideas a constant home that search engines can understand and return to users.\nThis is not brand building in the abstract sense; it is visibility building.\nWell-executed SEO content plays a critical role in brand building precisely because it operates at the point of repeated exposure. When a brand consistently appears for high-intent, non-branded queries, it earns familiarity before it ever earns loyalty.\nVisibility-led content does not need to be overtly promotional to do this work. In many cases, its impact is stronger when it is practical, authoritative, and clearly written for the user rather than for the brand. Over time, this consistency creates an association between the problem space and the brand itself.\nThis is where many brand discussions lose precision. Brand is not only shaped by creative campaigns or opinion pieces. It is shaped by whether a brand reliably shows up with useful answers when someone is trying to understand a topic, solve a problem, or make a decision.\nStrong SEO content compounds over time, and each ranking page reinforces the others. An example of this is some work I did back with Cloudflare in mid-2017. A content hub, positioned as a “learning center,” that we developed and rolled out a section at a time, has compounded over the years to achieve millions of organic visits, and collected over 30,000 backlinks.\nEach impression adds to mental availability, and each return visit subtly shifts perception from unfamiliar to known. This is slow work, but it is measurable, and it is durable, and builds signals over time through Chrome, and in turn, begins to feed its own growth.\nIn this sense, SEO content is not separate from brand building. It is one of the few channels where brand perception can be shaped at scale, repeatedly, and in moments of genuine user need.\nThought leadership content has real value, but only under specific conditions. It needs an audience, a distribution strategy, and a feedback loop.\nOne of the most common patterns seen over the years is organizations investing heavily in senior-led opinion pieces, vision statements, or industry commentary, and then assuming impact by default.\nWhen performance is examined properly, using analytics platforms or marketing automation data, it often becomes clear that very few people are actually reading the content.\nIf nobody is consuming it, it is not thought leadership. It is publishing for internal reassurance.\nThis is not an argument against opinion-led content. It is an argument for accountability. Content should earn its place by contributing to visibility, engagement, or downstream commercial outcomes, even if those outcomes sit higher in the funnel.\nThat requires measurement beyond pageviews. It requires understanding how content is discovered, how it is referenced elsewhere, how it supports other assets, and whether it creates repeat exposure over time.\nThe current challenge for SEOs is not choosing between brand building and visibility building. It is learning how to balance the two without confusing them.\nBrand is the outcome of repeated, coherent experiences. Visibility is the mechanism that makes those experiences possible at scale. You cannot shortcut one with the other, and you cannot treat them as interchangeable.\nFor practitioners who have grown up inside SEO, this means expanding beyond the channel without abandoning its discipline. It means understanding distribution as well as creation, signals as well as stories, and measurement as well as messaging.\nThe future does not belong to those who simply declare themselves a brand. It belongs to those who understand how visibility compounds, how trust is earned gradually, and how SEO fits into a much wider system of influence.\nBuilding a brand is not the answer. It is the work that begins once the question has finally been asked properly."

    "content": "functioned as a marketplace of attention. Now it is becoming a marketplace of intent. Large language models understand what users mean, not just what they type. They can answer intent directly. Sending people to websites to find answers is no longer required.\nFor more than 20 years, the web ran on an unwritten trade. Creators produced content. Search engines distributed traffic as payment. You shared knowledge with the web. The web repaid you with visibility.\nThat trade built the digital economy, funded journalism and fueled brands. Each article, review and tutorial acted as a small handshake in a system built on reciprocity. That handshake is slipping.\nAI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT and Perplexity now generate answers on their own. They draw from the world’s content but rarely return audiences to the source. Google’s AI Overviews summarize entire pages directly in search results. Chatbots respond without clicks, often without citations.\nA relationship that once felt balanced now tilts in one direction. The impact depends on the business model. Some companies earn money through content. Others earn money because of content. In simple terms, content is either the product or the promotion — familiar territory from Kotler’s 4Ps.\nWe’ve entered the zero-click era — shifting from finding answers on websites to getting them directly on the search page. A zero-click search occurs when a user enters a prompt and receives the result without having to click on anything. AI assistants and search engines now rely on snippets, knowledge panels, answer boxes, calculators, maps, definitions and AI-generated summaries. In practice, users get what they need without clicking through to an external site.\nExact numbers are difficult to determine, yet every primary source reveals the same pattern. Zero-click searches dominate. SparkToro estimates 59% in 2024. Early 2025 data from Similarweb indicate a figure of 69% . A May 2025 analysis, also from Similarweb, reports it has reached 83% . Together, these figures trace a clear shift.\nThe exchange rate behind this change tells the real story. It was once healthy. According to Cloudflare , it is now at a breaking point.\nFor AI companies, like OpenAI, Claude and Perplexity, it creates pressure. Their most valuable resource, human-curated/created content, becomes harder to sustain. AI is eating its sources. But for brands, publishers and creators, the pressure is bigger and existential. Traffic no longer follows effort.\nOrganic traffic to news sites is falling fast. Creators and publishers, such as Business Insider, have seen drops of more than 50% between April 2022 and April 2025 . The pattern repeats across the industry. The Similarweb chart below shows how zero-click answers rise while organic traffic declines. AI eats the source material. It consumes the content but does not return to the audience.\nThis puts publishers in a new position. Their content is not just promotion. It is their expertise sold as a product. When platforms extract value without sending users back, the product loses its market.\nPublishers are responding with new revenue models. The goal is the same. If platforms take value without returning traffic, publishers want compensation for the content that powers those platforms.\nOne model is paid crawling. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince calls it pay-per-crawl. Bots that scrape a site would pay for every visit. Cloudflare already sits in the path of a large share of web traffic, allowing it to enforce this rule at the infrastructure level.\nThis signals a shift. Publishers want a direct exchange. If AI systems rely on human-created content, they must contribute to its creation and maintenance costs. These are the early steps toward a new exchange rate for publishers and creators on the web.\nIn the old world, brands wrote to be found. SEO rewarded visibility. Expertise meant ranking high on Google. That model is changing fast. Brands now write for both people and machines, including language models.\nThis changes content’s job. Keywords matter less. Contextual expertise and authority matter more. Brands must write in a way that models understand their intent and context. Quality content becomes infrastructure for machine understanding, not just fuel for marketing campaigns.\nMarketing teams now optimize for summarization, not search. This transforms the field of SEO. Our own MartechMap.com data from May 2025 shows how quickly this is moving. Instead of declining, SEO tools now grow faster than any other category across 49 subsegments.\nThe stats are clear: the SEO category is exploding. The spike is due to existing and new SEO companies starting to provide capabilities for the new craft. This craft is appearing under names like generative engine optimization (GEO), AI optimization (AIO) and language engine optimization (LEO). The idea is simple. Content must be easy for AI to interpret and quote. The algorithm becomes the new editor. It decides which ideas thrive and which fade away.\nBrands have entered a new web economy. One where they write for both people and machines. One where the value of content depends on how well AI can absorb it. The exchange rate is intent-driven expertise.\nDig deeper: The brands winning with AI know when to use it — and when not to\nAI will not wait for new rules. Publishers must decide what access is worth. Brands must influence how models interpret their expertise. Platforms must define how they compensate the sources they rely on.\nThe exchange rate of the next web is being written now. Those who set their terms early will control their value. Those who do not will have it assigned to them.\nDig deeper: As data and content proliferate, context is poised to become the new king"
