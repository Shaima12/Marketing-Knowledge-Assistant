    "content": "Bluesky might’ve started as a side project, but it’s quickly making a name for itself in the social media landscape . In less than six months, it has grown from 10 million to over 30 million users, attracting everyone from artists and tech enthusiasts to public figures like Barack Obama.\nSo, is Bluesky worth testing out? It depends on several factors. If your target audience is on the network, or if having a presence on the network aligns with your goals and objectives, then it’s worth testing.\nSimilarly, it’s well worth it if you have the time and resources to test and learn the nuances of a new network and maintain a consistent presence there. Especially, since there are tons of opportunities for early adopters to experiment and make their mark on Bluesky’s passionate niche communities.\nThis article will get you up to speed on all things Bluesky. You’ll learn more about what it is, what users like about it, how it differs from other networks and how you can use Bluesky in Sprout Social.\nBluesky is a social app where people share short posts with text, images, videos, links and more. On the surface, Bluesky has a familiar microblog-style layout. But what really makes Bluesky unique is what’s under the hood.\nIt runs on the AT Protocol, an open-source framework that gives users more control over their social experience. This protocol allows users to take their identity and content with them if they leave. Different apps can also connect through the same network.\nCurious why people are spending more time on Bluesky? According to our Q3 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey, 51% of users are motivated to use Bluesky over similar networks because of the ability to control the content in their feed.\nHere’s a look at how it works and what makes it different.\nIf you’ve used any network with a feed, likes and replies, you’ll pick up Bluesky quickly. It has a clean, simple and recognizable layout.\nWhen you log in, you’ll see a navigation bar on the left with all the essentials:\nIn the center of the app, there are three main feed views:\nOn the right-hand side, you’ll see some trending topics to help you explore what people are talking about in real time.\nJust tap the little blue icon at the bottom left to start drafting a post. You have up to 300 characters to write, and the option to add photos, videos, GIFs and emojis, choose the language and set who can interact with your post.\nTo engage with other people’s posts, you can like, repost, quote post or reply.\nWhile the app looks familiar, Bluesky has some interesting features that you won’t find on other social networks.\nWhat really sets Bluesky apart is its customization. With Custom Feeds, users have more control over what shows up in their timeline. Want updates from quiet mutuals? Try the Quiet Posters feed. Into BookTok ? BookSky is the literary corner of Bluesky. Want to know what’s trending in your circle? Popular With Friends highlights posts from people you follow and the content they’re engaging with.\nYou know that awkward moment when you’re the first to show up at a party? Being early to a new app can feel the same way. Fortunately, Bluesky’s Starter Packs makes it easy to bring friends into your corner of Bluesky. This feature allows you to recommend your favorite accounts to follow and go-to Custom Feeds when you invite friends to join you.\nMost social media networks are closed systems, owned by a small group of decision-makers. TikTok influencers, for example, can’t just move their account, followers or content over to Instagram. Everything you create is locked into that app. For creators and brands, that means being at the mercy of network changes.\nBluesky flips that model on its head. It’s built to be open and portable within the AT Protocol network. In other words, your profile, posts and audience aren’t locked into Bluesky. Users can take everything with them if they decide to switch to another app built on the same protocol, without starting over.\nThink of it like keeping your phone number when you change carriers. Decentralization works in a similar way, giving creators and brands much more autonomy over their social presence.\nFrom its custom feeds to its ad-free model, Bluesky is carving out a niche in the social media world. In fact, our survey found that users are motivated the use the platform because of it’s key differences: 44% of users are motivated by the ad-free experience and 31% are motivated by its focus on communities and niche interests.\nMost social media platforms decide what appears in your feed, which usually includes a mix of popular posts, promoted content and updates from people you follow.\nBluesky takes a different approach. Instead of one default timeline, users can follow or create custom feeds, giving them more control over what they see and when.\nWant to keep up with a specific community or avoid certain content types? You’re in the driver’s seat.\nWith no ads (more on that in the next section) and a still-developing influencer scene, Bluesky’s social media culture feels more like the early internet than other networks. It’s creative and quirky, home to artists, writers, journalists and people who care about building authentic connections and cultivating a safe digital space.\nOne example is accessibility. Many users actively encourage image descriptions, and some even use the 2,000-character alt text limit to sneak in jokes or Easter eggs.\nIt also has thoughtful conflict management tools , such as strong blocks and reply limits, to prevent pile-ons and help users set boundaries.\nOverall, Bluesky is very community-oriented, so brands that want to establish a presence here should take a more casual, lo-fi approach to social media content creation . Focus on genuine, authentic connections and conversations.\nBluesky isn’t ad-supported and currently has no plans to be. Instead, it’s developing a subscription model for premium features like higher-quality video uploads, profile customization, post analytics, bookmark folders or translation tools.\nThis choice means that users and brands can’t ‘buy’ reach. The best way to grow and amplify your message is to build real relationships and show up in ways that resonate with your audience.\nAny platform trying to disrupt the status quo will face some big challenges, and Bluesky is no exception. As the network grows, there will be some growing pains, but there will also be valuable opportunities for those willing to experiment.\nBluesky’s decentralized social media approach gives users more agency, but it also makes moderation more complex. Right now, the platform supports a stackable moderation system that layers filters from various services. Users can subscribe to moderation “feeds” the same way they follow custom content feeds.\nBut without a universal rulebook, harmful content could slip through. Be mindful of which feeds or communities you align with, as they may impact how your audience perceives you.\nNo single algorithm helps niche communities thrive on Bluesky. But that freedom also means misinformation can spread quietly. For example, in 2024, Bluesky had spam accounts impersonating public figures and attempting to scam users.\nSince then, the network has rolled out more verification features, including domain handles, blue checks and trusted verifiers like The New York Times. For brands, investing in profile verification can go a long way in building trust.\nBluesky recently crossed the 30 million user mark. That’s impressive growth in a short time. Still, it’s on the smaller side compared to other networks. Threads, for instance, hit 275 million monthly users by late 2024.\nBut its modest size is also part of the appeal. With less noise and competition, Bluesky feels more like a creative sandbox. It’s the perfect place to test new ideas and explore new ways of engaging. For brands that value creativity and early momentum, it’s a rare chance to help shape the culture of a growing network.\nThe Bluesky culture today is creative, curious and deeply people-first. Conversations tend to feel more thoughtful and grounded, giving brands a real opportunity to grow their presence through meaningful interactions, rather than surface-level engagement.\nPlus, with strong niche communities already forming—especially among artists, writers, tech folks and journalists—Bluesky offers a chance to connect with more focused and active audiences.\nAs the network grows, brands entering the scene now should know that this is not the place for copy-paste brand messaging. Corporate speak probably won’t land. But if you show up as a considerate, values-aligned participant, you’ll stand out.\nSprout’s BlueSky integration is apt for brands looking to diversify their social media presence and engage with niche communities on culture and current events. It also enables you to experiment with your content by tracking key metrics and grow your audience through posting and scheduling at optimal times.\nThis dual approach helps build a resilient brand presence on the decentralized network and connect with audiences seeking genuine, algorithm-free engagement. And this gets you ahead of the curve as your competitors catch up. We’re already seeing specific strategies develop for universities on Bluesky to connect with students and researchers\nHere are more details about Sprout’s intuitive Publishing and Reporting capabilities.\nYou can publish images, text posts and videos to Bluesky directly from Sprout , as well as schedule and compose your posts in advance.

Available as an Add-on, with the integration, you can query Bluesky data as part of a Listening topic to get the insights you need.\nSprout’s robust Bluesky reporting enables you to seamlessly track, measure and report on your Bluesky performance.

    "date": "2025-12-17T14:00:21+00:00",
    "content": "Creating content that truly connects with Australian audiences starts with understanding what drives them. Every business has its own story, but the most successful ones strike the right balance between building community and delivering ROI.\nStrong Instagram strategies go beyond aesthetics to build trust, celebrate local culture and highlight your brand’s values in meaningful ways.\nWhether you’re launching a campaign or posting in the moment, these 20 business Instagram ideas will help you level up your Instagram marketing strategy and make an impact with every post.\nFostering genuine connection is the foundation of a strong social strategy. In Australia, that means leaning into values like authenticity, mateship and local pride.\nThe below ideas will help you show up in ways that earn attention and build lasting trust while giving your followers a reason to care (and come back):\nFinding ways to build instant trust and brand awareness with new audiences is a top priority for any Australian brand on Instagram. Influencer collaborations can fast-track credibility, especially when those influencers reflect local values and speak with cultural fluency.\nPartnering with a sustainability advocate or foodie TikToker adds authenticity while extending your reach.\nNeutriderm and Tully Smyth collaborated to create Reels showcasing her daily routine and explaining how the brand’s products work. This partnership is a great model for how Australian brands can use social media to blend influence with impact.\nSocial media isn’t just a broadcast channel; it’s where conversations happen, too. To make your brand more approachable and give your audience a voice, try hosting Q&A sessions on Instagram.\nYou can also use Instagram Stories or Live to answer common customer questions or walk new followers through a product tutorial, just like skincare brand INBLEUM did.\nShowing up for your community means embracing its cultural calendar. Luckily, Australia’s diverse cultural landscape provides many opportunities for brands to connect meaningfully.\nWhether it’s Diwali in Parramatta or Lunar New Year in Melbourne, regional celebrations give brands a way to participate with relevance.\nAustralian values like fairness, camaraderie and environmental consciousness set the tone for emotionally engaging content. To capitalize on this, use Instagram Reels to document team volunteer work or promote homegrown, ethical products.\nMelbourne-based streetwear label HoMie often uses Reels to highlight its social mission of supporting young people affected by homelessness. This authentic, community-centered storytelling highlights the shared effort of HoMie and its customers, giving everyday Australians a chance to feel involved and impactful.\nYour values are your brand’s compass, and bringing them to the forefront not only humanises your business on Instagram but also helps you build an emotional connection. Even simple ideas like behind-the-scenes videos of team celebrations or office banter during footy finals can make your account feel personable.\nQantas used Instagram to showcase what it means to represent Australia. Beyond travel content, the airline shares posts showing how it honours Australia’s First Peoples, celebrates culture, and promotes connection.\nSocial proof is powerful. Sharing real customer experiences builds trust and nudges followers toward action. To do this, use static posts or Reels to showcase reviews in a way that feels genuine and aligned with your brand voice.\nAustralian home fragrance brand Urban Rituelle uses Instagram Stories to feature customer reviews of its eco-friendly candles. The Story highlights phrases like “beautiful scent” over calm, candle-lit product visuals. The result is simple, authentic and deeply relatable.\nWant to extend your content’s reach? Speak your audience’s language and capitalize on what’s trending using hashtags.\nUsing localized tags like #smallbizau or #melbournefoodie makes it easier for new customers to discover you.\nThe Playtime Store knows exactly who engages with its content and uses parent-focused hashtags like #melbournemum and #kiwimums to help new audience members find its content on Instagram.\nUser-generated content (UGC) fuels trust while reducing your team’s creative load. When followers see themselves reflected in your feed, they feel like part of your community. To do this, prioritise images and videos that align with your brand’s aesthetic and show genuine engagement with your followers.\nUGC like the post @bysharnaya shared about Grants of Australia ’s Liquid Chlorophyll is the perfect way to combine social proof, trust, and influence.\nPeople love freebies, but thoughtful giveaways do more than boost Likes. They also introduce new audiences to your brand and encourage repeat engagement. Celebrating milestones or local holidays with themed bundles or cross-brand collabs is the perfect way to accomplish this.\nFor example, Bickfords sponsored a giveaway of its flavoured syrups, which not only draws new audience members but also potential customers.\nAustralia’s cultural calendar is full of moments that matter: sporting events, holidays and festivals that unite communities and create shared experiences. Your content can spark real engagement by meeting people where they are, whether it’s a live event or a midwinter celebration.\nThe below ideas will help you tap into this energy in a way that’s timely, relevant and brand-aligned:\nCapturing real-time excitement is one of the most effective ways to energise your Instagram presence. Live content creates a sense of urgency and draws audiences into brand moments as they happen.\nWhether you’re launching a product in Melbourne or hosting a vendor stall at a Far North Queensland market like NJoy Designs , going live gives your followers a front-row seat.\nThis mid-year festive celebration is the perfect chance for brands to create playful content and reconnect with audiences during the winter lull. Think themed decor, limited-time offers or cheeky team content that embraces the cosiness of a cold-weather Christmas.\nReels work especially well here, while humour and nostalgia, like the vibes featured in Finch and Lane ’s Christmas in July post, tend to drive saves and shares.\nSport is deeply interwoven within the fabric of Australian life. From State of Origin to the AFL Grand Final, national and regional events offer high-visibility moments to align your brand with local pride.\nTo engage more deeply with your Australian audience, you can celebrate wins, show team spirit or offer limited-edition e-commerce products tied to the event. Pairing a giveaway with a sporting event is sure to rally fans as well. For example, White Cockatoo Hotel gave away footys and cash for a State of Origin game.\nSprout allows you to time your posts strategically and measure reach and sentiment in the process.\nParticipating in culturally significant days shows that your brand tunes into what matters to your audience. But it has to be thoughtful, not performative.\nTake Australia Zoo ’s post honoring World Turtle Day and legendary Australian Steve Irwin. The post comes across as purpose-driven rather than performative, demonstrating a clear tie between Steve and turtles across the globe.\nHighlighting your products and services shouldn’t feel like a hard sell. These ideas are what help you turn what you offer into stories that your audience actually wants to follow.\nTactics like sneak peeks, behind-the-scenes moments and local twists on your latest launches show your value in a way that feels human and distinctly Australian. Here are some more ideas to get you started:\nAudiences crave transparency. Offering a look behind the curtain not only builds trust but also deepens the connection between your followers and your brand.\nTo convey this, take your audience on a journey through how you make your products or deliver your services. Reels, Stories and even carousels work well for short, digestible glimpses.\nYour team is part of your brand story too. Showcasing them on Instagram builds personality and reinforces your brand from the inside out. To do this, share interviews, their favourite local spots or day-in-the-life content.\nStaff highlights, like humorous Reels featuring interviews with Canva employees, also tend to boost morale internally while humanising your brand externally.\nVisual context matters. Including recognisable Australian backdrops in your posts helps you anchor your brand, both geographically and visually.\nFrom Bondi sunrise shoots to laneway cafés in Fitzroy, familiar landscapes boost relevance and make your content stand out. You can even make a game of it, as Go-To Skincare did for its special event at Warringah Mall.\nTwo-way engagement turns followers into collaborators. That’s where polls come in. They not only boost interaction but also provide valuable insights.\nYou can use Instagram Stories to ask for product preferences, content requests or local event suggestions. Even a question as simple as “This or that?” (or “Left or right?” for edible bouquet brand Lunch Bunch ) gets audience members to share their opinions.\nShort-form video isn’t just trendy, it’s one of the most effective ways to drive visibility on Instagram, too. Especially for small businesses.\nStorytelling, though, is what makes it stick. This could mean narrating a customer transformation, sharing the inspiration behind a new product or highlighting your journey as a business owner, as Tarts Anon founders Gareth and Cat did. Be sure to then monitor shares and completion rate in Sprout to optimise future content.\nThe best campaigns start before the product hits the shelf. These teasers build anticipation and give your audience a reason to stay tuned. A mix of countdowns, sneak peeks and early access links is a great way to pull this off.\nNothing sells like scarcity. To capitalize on your audience’s FOMO, run posts that feature limited-run products tied to cultural moments, regional pride, local themes or seasonal events to create urgency and tap into your audience’s identity.\nYou can highlight availability through captions and Stories, just like small biz owner Laura Hand did for her brand Joelle Designs .\nCreating high-performing content starts with understanding your audience and showing up in the moments that matter to them. The above Instagram ideas, from influencer partnerships to Reels that tap into regional culture, encourage both connection and conversion.\nTools like Sprout Social help you go beyond vanity metrics with built-in performance data, automation and cross-team collaboration. That way, you’re always aware of what your audience is saying and how they’re engaging, so your social strategy doesn’t miss a beat.\nReady to see how your Instagram content stacks up?
