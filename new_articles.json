Position 1 organic results that previously captured 30-35% CTR might see rates drop to 15-20% when an AI Overview appears above them.\nIndustry observations indicate that AI Overviews appear 60-80% of the time for certain query types. For these keywords, traditional CTR models and traffic projections become meaningless. The entire click distribution curve shifts, but we lack the data to model it accurately.\nKnowing how often AI Overviews appear for your keywords can help guide your strategic planning.\nWithout this data, teams may optimize aimlessly, possibly focusing resources on keywords dominated by AI Overviews or missing chances where traditional SEO can perform better.\nBeing cited can enhance brand authority even without direct clicks, as people view your domain as a trusted source by Google.\nMany domains with average traditional rankings lead in AI Overview citations. However, without citation data, sites may struggle to understand what they’re doing well.\nThe impact on click-through rate can vary depending on the type of query and the format of the AI Overview.\nTo accurately model CTR, it’s helpful to understand:\nUnfortunately, Search Console doesn’t provide any of these data points.\nCurrently, reporting relies on assumptions and observed correlations rather than direct measurements. Teams make educated guesses about the impact of AI Overview based on changes in CTR, but they can’t definitively prove cause and effect.\nWithout solid data, every choice we make is somewhat of a guess, and we miss out on the confidence that clear data can provide.\nSince Google Search Console won’t show you AI Overview data, you’ll need to collect it yourself. The most straightforward approach is manual checking. Yes, literally searching each keyword and documenting what you see.\nThis method requires no technical skills or API access. Anyone with a spreadsheet and a browser can do it. But that accessibility comes with significant time investment and limitations. You’re becoming a human web scraper, manually recording data that should be available through GSC.\nFor 100 keywords across three locations, this process takes approximately 15 hours per week.\nIf ~15 hours a week of manual SERP checks isn’t realistic, automate it. An API call gives you the same AIO signal in seconds, on a schedule, and without human error. The tradeoff is a little setup and usage costs, but once you’re tracking ~50+ keywords, automation is cheaper than people.\nPaste this into your browser to pull only the AI Overview for a test query:\nIf Google returns a page_token instead of the full text, run this second request:\nIf you don’t want to write code, you can call this from Google Sheets (see the tutorial) , Make , or n8n and log three fields per keyword: AIO present (true/false), AIO position, and AIO sources.\nThe API returns comprehensive AI Overview data that GSC doesn’t provide:\nThis structured data integrates directly into existing SEO workflows. Export to Google Sheets for quick analysis, push to BigQuery for historical tracking, or feed into dashboard tools for client reporting.\nWhether you build your own tracker or use existing tools, the data pipeline follows this pattern:\nInclude categorization to identify AI Overview patterns by intent type. Informational queries typically show higher AI Overview rates than navigational ones.\nCalculate the following key metrics from your collected data:\nCombine with GSC data to measure CTR differences between keywords with and without AI Overviews.\nThese metrics provide the visibility GSC lacks, enabling data-driven optimization decisions.\nWith AI Overview tracking data, you can provide clients with concrete answers about their search performance.\nInstead of vague statements, you can present specific metrics, such as: “AI Overviews appear for 47% of your tracked keywords, with your citation rate at 23% compared to your main competitor’s 31%.”\nThis transparency transforms client relationships. When they ask why impressions increased 40% but clicks only grew 5%, you can show them exactly how many queries now trigger AI Overviews above their organic listings.\nMore importantly, this data justifies strategic pivots and budget allocations. If AI Overviews dominate your client’s industry, you can make the case for content optimization targeting AI citation.\nGoogle’s AI Overview rollout is uneven, occurring in waves that test different industries and query types at different times.\nWithout proper tracking, you might not notice these updates for weeks or months, missing crucial optimization opportunities while competitors adapt.\nContinuous monitoring of AI Overviews transforms you into an early warning system for your clients or organization.\nBy carefully tracking your content, you’ll quickly notice patterns, such as content types that consistently earn citations.\nThe data also reveals competitive advantages. For example, traditional ranking factors don’t always predict whether a page will be cited in an AI Overview. Sometimes, the fifth-ranked page gets consistently cited, while the top result is overlooked.\nAdditionally, tracking helps you understand how citations relate to your business metrics. You might find that being cited in AI Overviews improves your brand visibility and direct traffic over time, even if those citations don’t result in immediate clicks.\nGoogle has shown no indication of adding AI Overview filtering to Search Console. The API roadmap doesn’t mention it. Waiting for official support means flying blind indefinitely.\nIf manual tracking isn’t sustainable, we offer a free tier with 250 searches/month so you can validate your pipeline. For scale, our published caps are clear: 20% of plan volume per hour on plans under 1M/month, and 100,000 + 1% of plan volume per hour on plans ≥1M/month.\nWe also support enterprise plans up to 100M searches/month. Same production infrastructure, no setup.\nWhether you choose manual tracking, build your own scraping solution, or use an existing API, the important thing is to start measuring. Every day without AI Overview visibility is a day of missed optimization opportunities.\nThe tools and methods exist. The patterns are identifiable. You just need to implement tracking that fills the gap Google won’t address.\nFor those interested in the automated approach, access SerpApi’s documentation and test the playground to see what data becomes available. For manual trackers, download our spreadsheet template to begin tracking immediately."
