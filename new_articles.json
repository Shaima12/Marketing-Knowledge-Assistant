    "content": "The internet has changed. Channels have begun to homogenize. Google is trying to become something of a destination, and the individual content creator is more powerful than ever .\nBut what makes for great content hasn’t changed. AI and LLMs haven’t changed what people want to consume. They’ve changed what we need to click on. Which I don’t necessarily hate.\nAs long as you’ve been creating well-structured, engaging, educational/entertaining content for years. All this chat of chunking is a bit smoke and mirrors for me.\n“If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a grifter selling you link building services or GEO.”\nHowever, it is absolutely not all rubbish. Concepts like ambiguity are a more destructive force than ever. If you permit a quick double negative, you cannot not be clear.\nThe clearer you are. The more concise. The more structured on and off-page. The better chance you stand. There’s no place for ambiguous phrases, paragraphs, and definitions.\nDisambiguation is the process of resolving ambiguity and uncertainty in data. Ambiguity is a problem in the modern-day internet. The deeper down the rabbit hole we go, the less diligence is paid towards accuracy and truth. The more clarity your surrounding context provides, the better.\nIt is a critical component of modern-day SEO, AI, natural language processing (NLP), and information retrieval .\nThis is an obvious and overused example, but consider a term like apple. The intent and understanding behind it are vague. We don’t know whether people mean the company, the fruit, the daughter of a batshit, brain-dead celebrity.\nYears ago, this type of ambiguous search would’ve yielded a more diverse set of results. But thanks to personalization and trillions of stored interactions, Google knows what we all want. Scaled user engagement signals and an improved understanding of intent and keywords, phrases, and context are fundamental here.\nYes, I could’ve thought of a better example, but I couldn’t be bothered. You see my point.\nModern-day information retrieval requires clarity. The context you provide really matters when it comes to a confidence score systems require when pulling the “correct” answer.\nAnd this context is not just present in the content.\nThere is a significant debate about the value of structured data in modern-day search and information retrieval. Using structured data like sameAs to signify exactly who this author is and tying all of your company’s social accounts and sub-brands together can only be a good thing.\nThe argument isn’t that this has no value. It makes sense.\nAmbiguity and information retrieval have become incredibly hot topics in data science. Vectorization – representing documents and queries as vectors – helps machines understand the relationships between terms.\nIt allows models to effectively predict what words should be present in the surrounding context. It’s why answering the most relevant questions and predicting user intent and ‘what’s next’ has been so valuable for a long time in search.\nDo you remember what Google’s early, and official, mission statement regarding information was?\n“Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”\nTheir former motto was “don’t be evil.” Which I think in more recent times they may have let slide somewhat. Or conveniently hidden it.\nOrganizing the world’s information has become so much more effective thanks to advances in information retrieval. Originally, Google thrived on straightforward keyword matching. Then they moved to tokenization .\nTheir ability to break sentences into words and match short-tail queries was revolutionary. But as queries advanced and intent became less obvious, they had to evolve.\nThe advent of Google’s Knowledge Graph was transformational. A database of entities that helped create consistency. It created stability and improved accuracy in an ever-changing web.\nNow queries are rewritten at scale. Ranking is probabilistic instead of deterministic, and in some cases, fan-out processes are applied to create an all-encompassing answer. It’s about matching the user’s intent at the time. It’s personalized. Contextual signals are applied to give the individual the best result for them.\nWhich means we lose predictability depending on temperature settings, context, and inference path . There’s a lot more passage-level retrieval going on.\nThanks to Dan Petrovic, we know that Google doesn’t use your full page content when grounding its Gemini-powered AI systems. Each query has a fixed grounding budget of approximately 2,000 words total, distributed across sources by relevance rank.\nThe higher you rank in search, the more budget you are allotted. Think of this context window limit like crawl budget . Larger windows enable longer interactions, but cause performance degradation. So they have to strike a balance.\nThese older algorithm shifts were pivotal in making Google’s systems treat language and meaning differently.\nRankBrain was built on the success of Hummingbird’s semantic search. By mastering NLP systems, Google began mapping words to mathematical patterns (vectorization) to better serve new and ever-evolving queries.\nThese vectors help Google ‘guess’ the intent of queries it has never seen before by finding their nearest mathematical neighbors.\nIn July 2023, Google rolled out a major Knowledge Graph update . I think people in SEO called it the Killer Whale Update, but I can’t remember who coined the phrase. Or why. Apologies. It was designed to accelerate the growth of the graph and reduce its dependence on third-party sources like Wikipedia.\nAs somebody who has spent a long time messing around with entities, I can really understand why. It’s a giant, expensive time-suck.\nIt explicitly expanded and restructured how entities are recognized and classified in the Knowledge Graph. Particularly, person entities with clear roles such as author or writer .\nAll of this is an effort to combat AI slop, provide clarity, and minimize misinformation. To reduce ambiguity and to serve content where a living, breathing expert is at the heart of it.\nWorth checking whether you have a presence in the Knowledge Graph here . If you do and can claim a Knowledge Panel, do it. Cement your presence. If not, build your brand and connectedness on the internet.\nRAG is why traditional Google Search is still so important. The latest models no longer train on real-time data and lag a little behind . Before the primary model dives in to respond to your desperate need for companionship, a classifier determines whether real-time information retrieval is necessary .\nThey cannot know everything and have to employ RAG to make up for their lack of up-to-date information (or verifiable facts through their training data) when retrieving certain answers. Essentially trying to make sure they aren’t chatting rubbish.\nSo, each model needs its own form of disambiguation. Primarily, this is achieved via:\nRemember, if your content isn’t accessible to search retrieval systems it can’t be used as part of a grounding response. There’s no separation here.\nIf you have wanted to do well in search over the last decade, this should’ve been a core part of your thinking. Helpful content rewards clarity.\nAllegedly. It also rewards nerfing smaller sites out of existence.\nRemember that being clever isn’t better than being clear.\nDoesn’t mean you can’t be both. Great content entertains, educates, inspires, and enhances.\nYou need to learn how to write. Short, snappy sentences. Help people and machines connect the dots. If you understand the topic, you should know what people want or need to read next almost better than they do.\nWrite in clear, straightforward paragraphs with a logical heading structure. You really don’t have to call it chunking if you don’t want to. Just make it easy for people and machines to consume your content.\nMake it easy for users to see what they’re getting and whether this page is right for them.\nLots of intent is static. Commercial queries always demand some level of comparison. Transactional queries demand some kind of buying or sales process.\nBut intent changes and millions of new queries crop up every day.\nSo, you need to monitor the intent of a term or phrase. News is probably a perfect example. Stories break. Develop. What was true yesterday may not be true today. The courts of public opinion damn and praise in equal measure.\nGoogle monitors the consensus . Tracks changes to documents. Monitors authority and – crucially here – relevance.\nYou can use something like Also Asked to monitor intent changes over time.\nFor years, structured data has helped resolve ambiguity. But we don’t have real clarity over its impact on AI search. Cleaner, well-structured pages are always easier to parse, and entity recognition really matters.\nIf you like messing around with the Knowledge Graph (who the hell doesn’t?), you can find confidence scores for your brand.\nAccording to Google’s very own guidelines , structured data provides explicit clues about a page’s content, helping search engines understand it better.\nYes, yes, it displays rich results etc. But it removes ambiguity.\nI think this ties everything together. Your brand, your products, your authors, your social accounts.\nWhat you say about your brand matters now more than ever.\nAll of it helps machines build up a clear picture of who you are. If you have strong social profiles, you want to make sure you’re leveraging that trust.\nAt a page level, title consistency, using relevant entities in your opening paragraph, linking to relevant tags and articles page, and using a rich, relevant author bio is a great start.\nThis post was originally published on Leadership in SEO ."
