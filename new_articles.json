    "content": "How many times have you seen different SERP layouts and results across markets?\nNo two people see the same search results, as per Google’s own documentation . No two users receive identical outputs from AI platforms either, even when using the same prompt. In a time of information overload, this raises an important question for global marketers: How do we manage and leverage personalized search experiences across multiple markets?\nToday, clarity and transparency matter more than ever. Users have countless choices and distractions, so they expect experiences that feel relevant, trustworthy, and aligned with their needs in the moment. Personalization is now central to how potential customers discover, evaluate, and engage with brands.\nSearch engines have been personalizing results for years based on language, search behavior, device type, and technical elements such as hreflang. With the quick evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI), personalization has expanded into summarized answers on AI platforms and hyper-personalized experiences that depend on internal data flows and processes.\nThis shift forces marketers to rethink how they measure visibility and business impact. According to McKinsey, 76% of users feel frustrated when experiences are not personalized, which shows how closely relevance and user satisfaction are linked.\nAt the same time, long-tail discovery increasingly happens outside of search engines, particularly on platforms like TikTok. Statista reports that 78% of global internet users now research brands and products on social media.\nAll of this is happening while most users know little about how search engines or AI systems operate .\nRegardless of where people search, the implications extend far beyond algorithms. Personalization affects how teams collaborate, how data moves across departments, and how global organizations define success.\nThis article explores what personalization means today and how global brands can turn it into a competitive advantage.\nSearch engines no longer return lists of blue links alone or People Also Ask (PAA). They now provide summarized information in AI Overviews and AI Mode, currently for informational queries.\nGoogle often surfaces AI summaries first and URLs second, while continuously testing different layouts for mobile and desktop, as shown below.\nScreenshot from search for [what is a nepo baby], Google, December 2025 Google’s Search Labs experiments, including features such as Preferred Sources, show how layouts and summaries change based on context, trust signals, and behavioral patterns.\nLarge language models (LLMs) add another layer. They adjust responses based on user context, intent, and sometimes whether the user has a free or paid account. Because users rarely get exactly what they need on the first attempt, they re-prompt the AI, creating iterative conversations where each instruction or prompt influences the next.\nWhat prompts users to click through to a source or research it on search engines, whether it is curiosity, uncertainty, boredom, a call-to-action, or the model stating it does not know, is still unclear. Understanding this behavior will soon be as important as traditional click-through rate (CTR) analysis.\nFor global brands, the challenge is not simply keeping up with technology. It’s maintaining a consistent brand voice and value exchange across channels and markets when every user sees a different interpretation of the brand. Trust is now as important as visibility.\nThis landscape increases the importance of market research, segmentation, cultural insights, and competitive analysis. It also raises concerns about echo chambers, search inequality, and the barriers brands face when entering new markets or reaching new audiences.\nMeanwhile, the long tail continues to shift to platforms like TikTok, where discovery works very differently from traditional search. And as enthusiasm for AI cools , many professionals believe we have entered the “trough of disillusionment” stage described by Jackie Fenn’s technology adoption lifecycle .\nIn marketing, personalization refers to tailoring content, offers, and experiences based on available data.\nIn search, it describes how search engines customize results and SERP features for individual users using signals such as:\nThe goal of search engines is to provide relevant results and keep users engaged, especially as people now search across multiple channels and AI platforms. As a result of this, two people searching the same query rarely see identical results. For example:\nSERP features can also vary across markets and profiles. People Also Ask (PAA) questions and filters may differ by region, language, or click behavior, and may not appear at all. For example, the query “vote of no confidence” displays different filters and different top results in Spain and the UK, and PAA does not appear in the UK version.\nAI platforms push this further with session-based memory . Platforms like AI Mode, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot handle context in a way that makes users feel there are real conversations, with each prompt influencing the next. In some cases, results from earlier responses may also be surfaced.\nA human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is essential to evaluate, monitor, and correct outputs before using them.\nPersonalization operates across several layers. Understanding these helps marketers see where influence is possible.\nGoogle and Bing adapt their layouts based on history, device type, user engagement, and market signals. Featured Snippets, PAA modules, videos, forums, or Top Stories may appear or disappear depending on behavior and intent.\nVisibility now includes being referenced in AI summaries. Current patterns show this depends on:\nWhen algorithms understand a brand, they can personalize results more accurately. Schema markup helps avoid entity drift, where regional websites are mistaken for separate brands.\nBing uses Microsoft Graph to connect brand data with the Microsoft ecosystem, extending the influence of structured data.\nLLMs simulate “memory” using context windows , which is the amount of information they can consider at once. This is measured in tokens, which represent words or parts of words. It is what makes conversations feel continuous.\nOnce an AI system associates a brand with a specific theme, that context can persist for a while, although it is unclear how long for. This is probably why LLMs favor fresh content as a way to reinforce authority.\nIn ecommerce and content-heavy sites, recommenders show personalized suggestions based on behavior. This reduces friction and increases time on site.\nWhen personalization works, users and brands can benefit from:\nThis can positively influence the customer lifetime value. However, these benefits rely on consistent and trustworthy experiences across channels.\nAlongside the benefits, personalization brings some challenges that marketers need to be aware of. These are not reasons to avoid personalization, but important considerations when planning global strategies. Consider:\nThis means that brands using the same template or unified content across markets for globalization lose even more effectiveness in markets, as cultural nuance, context, or different user motivations are expected. Furthermore, purchase journeys vary across markets. Hence, the effectiveness of hyper-personalization.\nIt is probably more important than ever that brands spend time researching and planning to gain or maintain visibility in global markets, as well as strengthening their brand perception.\nAt the moment, LLMs tend to favor strong, clearly structured brands and websites. If a brand is not well understood online, it is less likely to be referenced in AI summaries.\nSuccessful digital and SEO projects rely on strong internal processes. When teams work in isolation, inconsistencies appear in data, content, and technical implementation, which then surface as inconsistencies in personalized search.\nBelow is a framework to help organizations manage personalization across markets and channels.\nMany search or marketing challenges can be prevented by building a shared understanding across teams of:\nReinforce the technical elements of your website so that it is easy for search engines and LLMs to understand your brand across markets to avoid entity drift:\nStructure is everything. Organizing content into clusters helps users and search engines understand the website clearly, which supports personalization.\nInternal search and logged-in user experiences are important to understand your users and build user journeys based on behavior. This helps with content relevance and stronger intent signals.\nA coherent experience supports stronger personalization and prevents fragmented journeys, and search is only one personalized environment. Tone, structure, messaging, and data should remain consistent across:\nClear and consistent USPs should be visible everywhere.\nWith so much online competition, brands whose work is being referenced positively across the internet. It is the old PR: Focus on your strengths and publish well-researched work, with stats that are useful to your target users.\nConway’s Law matters more than ever. The idea that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures is highly visible in search today. If teams operate in silos , those silos often show up in fragmented content, inconsistent signals, and mixed user experiences. Personalization then amplifies these gaps even further by not being cited on AI platforms or the wrong information being spread.\nUnderstanding how personalization works and how it shapes visibility, trust, and user behavior helps brands deliver experiences that feel coherent rather than confusing.\nSuccess is no longer just about optimizing for Google. It is about understanding how people search, how AI interprets and summarizes content , how brands are referenced across the web, and how teams collaborate across channels to present a unified message.\nWhere every search result is unique, the brands that succeed will be the ones that coordinate, connect, and communicate clearly, both internally and across global markets, to help strengthen the perception of their brand."

    "content": "Today’s digital environment is unforgiving for global brands. The fallout of short-sighted strategy choices, misinformation, negative coverage and overlooked executive reputation gets amplified tenfold in search and chat.\nAs generative AI becomes the primary interface between audiences and information, brands face a growing risk: AI systems speak based on the information they see and trust. Without actively shaping that corpus, brands cede narrative control to third parties.\nAs AI adoption accelerates in 2026, what goes uncorrected today becomes tomorrow’s default narrative.\nA major error even the biggest brands make is treating controversy as a one-time event to react to, instead of something that’s minimized through proactive infrastructure. Today’s digital ecosystem proves that reaction isn’t enough. AI platforms can recirculate negative coverage indefinitely, resurfacing old controversies long after events pass. Unprepared brands face a massive risk when it comes to losing control of their brand narrative and stakeholder trust.\nTake Southwest Airlines, for example. Today, a quick ChatGPT search about Southwest still mentions the company’s 2022 holiday season service disruption, which affected almost 17,000 flights due to the winter storm Elliott.\nAt the time, the brand was unprepared for the long-reaching flood of negative content related to the event. Instead of having a network of owned assets to influence the narrative in the event of a crisis, the airline was trapped in reaction mode, scrambling to mitigate reputational harm from behind.\nHigh-profile crises like this damage financial health — including a $140 million fine by the U.S. Department of Transportation — but the narrative impact often lasts far longer. This coverage still appears in Southwest’s branded search results in 2026, showing how AI systems continue to surface outdated narratives long after events pass.\nCrisis management must be an ongoing strategy of monitoring, response and reinforcement, powered by brand-influenced content. Brands must continuously publish updated, authentic content that is targeted and at a sufficient scale to influence negative sentiment in a positive direction. It’s the secret to coming out on top when the inevitable happens.\nDig deeper: How digital visibility drives — or destroys — brand trust\nThe personal reputations of executives have grown inseparable from the trustworthiness and market value of their organizations. Organic search results and generated responses increasingly link executive behavior directly to brand credibility, associating leadership actions and missteps with whether a company is perceived as trustworthy.\nThrough periods of controversy, third-party coverage and AI platforms can amplify executive narratives one response at a time, making leadership behavior inseparable from brand identity in generated outputs. When negative sentiment dominates that corpus, it doesn’t stay contained — it becomes the default context audiences encounter.\nThat dynamic played out clearly following Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022. The controversy surrounding Musk’s leadership style and rapid operational changes triggered advertiser boycotts and ongoing public scrutiny. Over time, third-party content and AI-driven responses reinforced those associations, tying the Twitter brand closely to Musk’s personal controversies rather than the platform’s broader value proposition. Within two years, the company was estimated to be worth 79% less , reflecting how deeply leadership credibility and brand trust had eroded.\nExecutive reputation has a direct and measurable impact on brand perception, trustworthiness and financial health. Brands that underestimate the role of executive narratives — or treat them as separate from marketing and communications strategy — risk losing control of how they are represented in AI-generated environments. Marketing and communications leaders must account for executive reputation as part of broader brand planning to maintain narrative control and preferred visibility with target audiences.\nDig deeper: GenAI is telling your brand’s story — with or without you\nAI-related ethical concerns, questions about best practices and oversight are trending topics as global organizations continue to integrate AI. Companies that rely on AI solutions for business operations without instituting data security, privacy, transparency and bias best practices risk backlash from consumers, prospective hires and employees alike.\niTutorGroup is one example. An English-language tutoring services provider, iTutorGroup, allegedly used an AI hiring tool to automatically reject job applicants based on their age. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued iTutorGroup for age discrimination , becoming the first EEOC anti-discrimination lawsuit involving AI software. This story remains a common narrative point in branded AI responses, continually associating the company with a past controversy rather than its current initiatives.\nAs companies roll out AI systems to support day-to-day operations, those efforts must include documented, consistent ethics and oversight. Many AI-driven controversies are avoidable through responsible deployment, governance and oversight. Ensure that fairness, transparency and accountability are your guides to protect your brand’s reputation.\nDig deeper: The hidden AI risk that could break your brand\nReputation is fragile, cumulative and algorithmically amplified. It must now be managed as a system, just as critical as revenue, product innovation or customer acquisition.\nAs we move into 2026, consider learning from these three examples and evolving your brand to meet the challenges of the moment, navigating a new path. Approach reputation management as a continuous project, be clear about how much executive reputation matters for brand health and make AI governance an internal imperative as AI becomes the norm.\nTake these steps to make a long-term investment in your reputation. It’s an opportunity for your brand and leaders to be known for their successes instead of their mistakes.\nDig deeper: How AI reads your brand and why meaning matters most"
