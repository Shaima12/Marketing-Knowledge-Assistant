    "content": "AI has drastically changed the marketing industry. From remapping the buyer's journey to changing the way we analyze data, to reshaping how we connect with consumers, almost everything is different from just a couple of years ago.\nA new age calls for a new playbook called Loop Marketing, and a new playbook calls for new tools. Keep reading to learn more about Loop Marketing software and its playbook so your business can seamlessly adapt to the new age of marketing.\nLoop Marketing is HubSpot's modern growth framework, designed for the AI-driven marketing landscape. The marketing framework reshapes the traditional linear funnel with a continuous cycle of four interconnected stages:\nLoop Marketing software is an integrated technology stack that addresses each stage through a unified system.\nUnlike legacy tools built for linear funnels that assumed predictable customer journeys through your website, Loop Marketing software recognizes that modern buyers circle through multiple touchpoints, often engaging with AI-powered search before ever clicking through to your site.\nThis new buyers' journey requires a modernized technological approach that combines AI capabilities with unified customer data to enable rapid personalization, multi-channel orchestration, and real-time optimization.\nTraditional marketing stacks force teams to manually stitch together insights across disconnected tools. However, Loop Marketing software uses AI to automatically learn from every interaction, apply those insights across channels, and compound performance with each cycle.\nEssentially, Loop Marketing software turns work that used to take months into days, and transforms marketing from a series of campaigns into an always-learning growth engine.\nThe Express stage is where your company establishes its identity and makes its goals and values known to its target audience. During the express stage, you will need to:\nHubSpot provides Loop Marketing software tools to help you complete the Express stage efficiently, allowing you to maintain a consistent brand voice, guide, and identity. To accomplish the Express stage:\nThe Tailor stage is where you create personal messaging that makes your audience feel seen and valued. During the Tailor stage, you'll need to:\nTo complete the Tailor stage with dynamic and personalized messaging and marketing materials, use the following Loop Marketing software tools found in HubSpot's Marketing Hub :\nThe amplify stage is the most comprehensive part of Loop Marketing and contains a lot of moving parts, but don‘t be discouraged. In addition to building your content strategy, you’ll need to diversify the channels through which your brand appears to reach customers. To do this, optimize for LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude, as well as YouTube, community platforms, forums, and LinkedIn.\nAdditionally, to accomplish the Amplify stage, you should:\nUse the following tools to complete the Amplify stage:\nThe evolve stage of Loop Marketing is where you continue to refine and adapt your strategy to the ever-changing AI-marketing landscape. You succeed in the evolve stage by creating a feedback loop that uses AI to track performance and deliver timely recommendations for improvement.\nHere are some tools to help you successfully complete the evolve stage:\nFor Loop Marketing to work, your data must flow seamlessly at each stage and be especially in sync between the Tailor and Amplify stages. HubSpot's Smart CRM and Data Hub act as the connective tissue by syncing customer insights from your data warehouse, ad platforms, social channels, and website into a unified view.\nThis integration layer ensures the Tailor stage has accurate, real-time data to personalize experiences, while the Amplify stage can immediately act on behavioral signals—whether that's triggering a targeted ad campaign based on website activity or adjusting social messaging based on CRM engagement patterns.\nBut connectivity alone isn't enough. Effective Loop Marketing software must handle identity resolution across touchpoints, maintain data governance standards, and respect consent preferences at every stage.\nHubSpot's approach ensures that as customer data moves through your marketing loops, it remains compliant with privacy regulations and tied to a single, reliable customer identity.\nThis means your personalization efforts remain both practical and trustworthy—no duplicate records confuse your campaigns, no consent violations undermine customer trust, and no governance gaps create compliance risk.\nThough the terms sound similar, Loops is an email platform brand, while Loop Marketing is a four-stage playbook meant to help marketers succeed in the AI era. However, platforms like Loops can fit into the Amplify stage of Loop Marketing, as they can help you maximize the impact of your content and diversify across channels like email.\nNo, you don‘t necessarily need a separate CDP to run the Tailor and Amplify stages. HubSpot’s Smart CRM, combined with Data Hub, handles customer data unification, segmentation, and activation for most marketing teams.\nStacking HubSpot's Smart CRM and Data Hub enables resolution, behavioral tracking, and data synchronization across your ad platforms, website, and communication channels—everything needed to personalize in the Tailor stage and activate campaigns in the Amplify stage.\nA warehouse-native CDP may add value if you're managing massive data volumes, need complex data science models, or require deep integration with legacy enterprise systems.\nHowever, avoid duplicative data sprawl. If you're already consolidating customer data in a warehouse, connect it to HubSpot through Data Studio rather than creating redundant systems. Most teams find that Smart CRM plus Data Hub eliminates the need for a separate CDP.\nRun a 30-day pilot using HubSpot's free or Starter tier while keeping your existing systems in place. Pick one high-impact channel — email is usually the easiest entry point—and integrate one or two data sources (your website and maybe your ad platform).\nUse Breeze Assistant to generate campaign concepts, create a simple audience segment based on engagement data, and launch a tailored campaign. This low-risk approach enables you to demonstrate Loop Marketing's value without disrupting your current tech stack.\nOnce you see results, you can expand to additional channels and upgrade tiers as needed.\nUse this scorecard to track performance across the loop:\nTrack these metrics at the stage level first, then roll them up to assess overall loop performance.\nAlthough there is no universal “best time” to bring creators and communities into your Amplify plan, they become especially necessary when you're ready to expand your reach into new audiences or platforms where your brand lacks authority.\nLook for trusted voices who already engage your ideal customer profile and whose values align with your brand identity. Start with micro-influencers or active community members who have proven engagement rather than chasing follower counts.\nMeasure the creator's impact through trackable links, promo codes, or UTM parameters to monitor traffic, conversion lift, and cost per acquisition compared to your other Amplify channels.\nIf creator content drives significantly higher conversions than standard ads or community-generated content increases time on site, double down on this approach. Ensure you're using intent signals and enrichment data to understand which creator partnerships actually drive results versus just generating vanity metrics.\nLoop Marketing is the playbook for marketers who want to succeed in the modern AI landscape while evolving to tackle the next wave of innovation. By investing in Loop Marketing software, you'll prepare your business for the road ahead and make meaningful connections with your target consumer."

    "title": "Questions The CEO Should Be Asking About Their Website (But Rarely Does) via @sejournal, @billhunt",
    "date": "2025-12-17T12:30:25+00:00",
    "content": "Few CEOs ever ask hard questions about their company website. They’ll sign off on multimillion-dollar redesigns, approve ad budgets, and endorse “digital transformation” plans, but rarely ask how much enterprise value their digital infrastructure is actually creating.\nThat’s a problem, because the website is no longer a marketing artifact. It’s the factory floor of digital value creation. Every lead, sale, customer interaction, and data signal runs through it. When the site performs well, it compounds growth. When it underperforms, it silently leaks shareholder value.\nExecutives don’t need to understand HTML or crawl budgets . But they do need to ask sharper questions.  They need to ask the kind that expose hidden risk, surface inefficiencies, and align digital investments with measurable business outcomes. In the age of AI-driven search, where visibility and trust are determined algorithmically, these questions aren’t optional. They’re fiduciary.\nThere’s a persistent misconception in digital circles: that CEOs shouldn’t concern themselves with SEO, site performance, or technical issues. “That’s marketing’s job,” people say. But the truth is, these issues directly affect the metrics that boards and investors care about most – operating margin, revenue growth, capital efficiency, and risk mitigation.\nWhen a website is treated as an expense line rather than a capital asset, accountability disappears. Teams chase traffic over value, marketing spend rises to offset organic losses, and executives are left with fragmented data that hides the real cost of inefficiency.\nA CEO’s job isn’t to approve color palettes or keyword lists. It’s to ensure the digital infrastructure is producing measurable returns on invested capital just as they would for a factory, logistics system, or data center.\nEvery company has a “digital balance sheet,” even if it’s never been documented. Behind every campaign and click lies a network of dependencies, from page speed and content accuracy to structured data, discoverability, and cross-market alignment. When those systems falter, the losses are invisible but compounding:\nIn one multinational I audited, over $5 million per month in paid search spend was compensating for lost organic traffic caused by broken hreflang tags and indexation gaps.\nA similar disconnect played out publicly when the CMO of a major retail brand was asked during an earnings call about their online holiday strategy. He confidently declared, “As the largest reseller in our category, we’ll dominate the season online.” Within seconds, a reporter searched the category term, and the brand didn’t appear on page one. The CMO was stunned. He had assumed offline dominance guaranteed online visibility. It didn’t.\nThat thirty-second fact-check illustrated a billion-dollar truth: market leadership offline doesn’t ensure findability online. Without the right questions and governance, digital equity erodes silently until someone outside the company exposes it.\nNo CEO would tolerate that level of inefficiency in their supply chain. Yet it happens online every day, unnoticed, because few know which questions to ask.\nThese questions aren’t tactical; they’re financial. They surface whether the digital system that represents your brand to the world is operating efficiently, effectively, and in alignment with corporate goals.\nEach question reframes a “marketing” issue as a governance issue. When CEOs ask these questions, they encourage teams to think systemically, connecting content, code, and conversion as interdependent components of a single digital value chain.\nAsking the right questions isn’t micromanagement – it’s leadership through intent.\nWhen a CEO defines the Commander’s Intent for digital, it brings clarity of purpose, alignment of teams, and shared metrics, and it changes how the organization approaches the web. Instead of chasing redesigns or vanity KPIs, teams operate with a shared understanding:\n“Our website’s job is to create enterprise value – measurable, sustainable, and scalable.”\nThis is where the Web Effectiveness Score or Digital Value Creation Framework bridges web metrics (load time, index coverage) to enterprise KPIs (ROIC, margin, growth). Once that link is visible, executives start managing digital performance as a financial asset because it is.\nCEOs who ask these questions consistently outperform those who don’t – not because they know more about SEO, but because they lead with system awareness. When they do:\nWasted Spend Decreases. Duplicative content, overlapping agencies, and redundant tools are identified and rationalized.\nVisibility and Trust Increase. Content becomes findable, structured, and cited by both search engines and generative AI.\nRisk Declines. Technical debt, migration shocks, and compliance failures are detected early.\nInnovation Accelerates. Modular systems and shared data layers enable faster experimentation.\nEnterprise Value Compounds. Web performance improvements flow into revenue growth and cost efficiency.\nThis is the same logic CFOs apply to physical assets. The only difference is that digital assets rarely appear on the balance sheet, so their underperformance remains invisible until a crisis.\nThe rise of generative search makes these questions urgent. Search is no longer a static list of links; it’s a recommendation system. AI engines evaluate authority, trust, and structured data across the web to synthesize answers.\nIf your website isn’t structured, trusted, and machine-readable, your company risks digital disintermediation and being invisible in the ecosystems that shape decisions. For CEOs, that’s not a marketing problem; it’s an enterprise risk.\nAs AI systems determine which brands get cited and recommended, your digital infrastructure becomes the new supply chain for relevance and reputation.\nThe CEOs who win the next decade won’t outspend their competitors – they’ll out-align them. They’ll treat digital infrastructure with the same financial discipline as physical assets, measure contribution instead of activity, and lead teams to think in systems rather than silos.\nEvery boardroom already measures financial capital. It’s time to start measuring digital capital, and your website is where it compounds.\nIn the AI era, your website isn’t just how people find you. It’s how machines define you."

    "content": "Link building outreach is not just blasting out emails. There’s also a conversation that happens when someone emails you back with a skeptical question. The following are tactics to use for overcoming skeptical responses.\nIn my opinion it’s always a positive sign when someone responds to an email, even if they’re skeptical. I consider nearly all email responses to be indicators that a link is waiting to happen. This is why a good strategy that anticipates common questions will help you convert skeptical responses into links.\nMany responses tend to be questions. What they are asking, between the lines, is for you to help them overcome their suspicions. Anytime you receive a skeptical response, try to view it as them asking you, “Help me understand that you are legitimate and represent a legitimate website that we should be linking to.”\nThe question is asked between the lines. The answer should similarly be addressed between the lines. Ninety nine percent of the time, a between-the-lines question should not be answered directly. The perfect way to answer those questions, the perfect way to address an underlying concern, is to answer it in the same way you received it, between the lines.\nCommon  and weird questions that I used to get were like:\nBefore I discuss how I address those questions, I want to mention something important that I do not do. I do not try to actively convert the respondent in the first response. In my response to their response to my outreach, I never ask them to link to the site.\nThe question of linking is already hanging in the air and is the object of their email to you- there is no need to bring that up. If in your response you ask them again to link to your site it will tilt them back to being suspicious of you, raising the odds of losing the link.\nIn trout fishing, the successful angler crouches so that the trout does not see you. The successful angler may even wear clothing that helps them blend into the background. The best anglers imitate the crane, a fish-eating bird that stands perfectly still, imperceptibly inching closer to its prey. This is done to avoid being noticed. Your response should imitate the crane or the camouflaged angler. You should put yourself into the mindset of anything but a marketer asking for a link.\nYour response must not be to immediately ask for a link because that in my opinion will just lose the link. So don’t do it just yet.\nOne approach that I used to use successful is what I called the Tribal Affinity approach. For a construction/home/real estate related campaign, I used to approach it with the mindset of a homeowner. I wouldn’t say that I’m a homeowner (even though I was), I would just think in terms of what would I say as a homeowner contacting a company to suggest a real estate or home repair type a link. In the broken link or suggest a link strategy, I would say that the three links I am suggesting for their links page have been useful to me.\nA tribal affinity response that was useful to me is to mirror the person I’m outreaching to, to assume the mindset of the person I am responding to. So for example, if they are a toy collector then your mindset can also be a toy collector. If the outreach target is a club member then your outreach mindset can be an enthusiast of whatever the club is about. I never claim membership in any particular organization, club or association. I limit my affinity to mirroring the same shared mindset as the person I’m outreaching to.\nAnother approach is to assume the mindset of someone who happened upon the links page with a broken link or missing a good quality link. When you get into the mindset the text of your email will be more natural.\nThus, when someone responds by challenging me by asking how I found their site or who am I working for my response is to just stick to my mindset of a homeowner and respond accordingly.\nAnd really, what’s going on is that they’re not really asking how you found their site. What they’re really asking, between the lines, is if you’re a marketer of some kind. You can go ahead and say yes, you are. Or you can respond between the lines and say that you’re just a homeowner. Up to you.\nThere are many variations to this approach. The important points are:\nGet into the mindset that gives you a plausible reason for finding their site and the best words for asking for a link will write themselves."
