    "content": "If it looks like an AI hallucination problem, and sounds like an AI hallucination problem, it’s probably a data hygiene problem.\nI’ve sat through dozens of demos this year where marketing leaders show me their shiny new AI agent, ask it a basic question, and watch it confidently spit out information that’s either outdated, conflicting, or flat-out wrong.\nThe immediate reaction is to blame the AI: “Oh, sorry the AI hallucinated. Let’s try something different.”\nDon’t shoot the messenger, as the saying goes. While the AI is the messenger bringing you what looks like inaccurate data or hallucination, it’s really sending a deeper message: Your data is a mess.\nThe AI is simply reflecting that mess back to you at scale.\nAn Adverity study found that 45% of marketing data is inaccurate .\nAlmost half of the data feeding your AI systems, your reporting dashboards, and your strategic decisions is wrong. And we wonder why AI agents give vague answers, contradict themselves, or pull messaging that no one’s used since 2022.\nWhen your foundational data argues with itself, AI doesn’t know which version to believe. So it picks one. Sometimes correctly. Often not.\nAI isn’t magic. It reflects whatever you feed it: the good, the bad, and the three-years-outdated.\nEveryone wants the “build an agent” sexy moment. The product demo that has everyone applauding. The efficiency gains that guarantee a great review, heck, maybe even a raise.\nBut the thing that makes AI useful is the boring, unsexy, foundational work of data discipline.\nI’ve watched companies spend six figures on AI infrastructure while their product catalog still has duplicate entries from a 2021 migration. I’ve seen sales teams adopt AI coaching tools while their CRM defines “qualified lead” three different ways depending on which region you ask.\nThe AI works exactly as designed. The problem is what it’s designed to work with.\nIf your system is messy, AI can’t clean it up (at least, not yet). It amplifies the mess at scale, across every interaction. As much as we would like for it to, even the sexiest AI model in the world won’t save you if your data foundation is broken.\nWhen your data is inaccurate, inconsistent, or outdated, mistakes are inevitable. These can get risky quickly, especially if they negatively impact customer experience or revenue.\nYour sales agent gives prospects pricing that changed six months ago because nobody updated the product sheet it’s trained on.\nYour content generation tool pulls brand messaging from 2020 because the 2026 messaging framework lives in a deck on someone’s desktop.\nYour lead scoring AI uses ICP criteria that marketing and sales never agreed on, so you’re nurturing the wrong prospects while ignoring the right ones.\nYour sales enablement agent recommends a case study for a product you discontinued last quarter because nobody archived the old collateral.\nThis is happening every single week in enterprises that have invested millions in AI transformation. And most teams don’t even realize it until a customer or prospect points it out.\nThe good news: You don’t need a massive transformation initiative to fix this. You need discipline and ownership.\nBefore you can fix your data problem, you need to understand its scope.\nPull every document, spreadsheet, presentation, and database your AI systems have access to. Don’t assume. Actually look.\nRetire what’s wrong. Update what’s salvageable. Be ruthless about what stays and what goes.\nThis is non-negotiable. Pick one system for every definition that matters to your business:\nEveryone pulls from it. No exceptions. No “but our team does it differently.”\nWhen marketing and sales use different definitions, your AI can’t arbitrate. It picks one randomly. Sometimes it picks both and contradicts itself across interactions.\nEvery asset your AI can access should have a “valid until” date.\nBattlecards. Case studies. Competitive intelligence. Messaging frameworks. Product specs.\nWhen it expires, it automatically disappears from AI access. No manual cleanup required. No hoping someone remembers to archive old content.\nStale data is worse than no data. At least with no data, your AI admits it doesn’t know. With stale data, it confidently delivers wrong information.\nDon’t assume your AI is working correctly. Test it.\nIf the answers conflict with what you know is true, you just found your data hygiene problem.\nRun these tests monthly. Your business changes. Your data should change with it.\nData discipline without ownership is a Slack thread that goes nowhere.\nOne person needs to be explicitly responsible for maintaining your source of truth. Not as an “additional responsibility.” As a core part of their role.\nWithout ownership, your data hygiene initiative dies in three months when everyone gets busy with other priorities.\nDeploying powerful AI on top of chaotic data is at best inefficient, but at worst, it can actively damage your brand, your customer relationships, and your competitive position.\nYou can have the most sophisticated AI model in the world. The best prompts. The most expensive infrastructure. None of it matters if you’re feeding it garbage. It takes a disciplined foundation to make it work.\nIt’s like seeing someone with perfectly white teeth and thinking they just got lucky. What you don’t see is the daily flossing, the regular dental cleanings, the discipline of avoiding sugar and brushing twice a day for years.\nOr watching an Olympic athlete make a performance look effortless. You’re not seeing the 5 a.m. training sessions, the strict diet, the thousands of hours of practice that nobody applauds.\nTo get real value and ROI from AI, start with setting it up for success with the right data foundation. Yes, it might not be the most glamorous or exciting work. But it is what makes the glamorous and exciting possible.\nRemember, your AI isn’t hallucinating. It’s telling you exactly what your data looks like."
