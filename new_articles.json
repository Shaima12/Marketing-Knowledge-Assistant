    "content": "If you‘re familiar with the world of SEO, I probably don’t have to tell you there's been a serious shift in its landscape. Marketers are no longer just optimizing content for Google‘s traditional blue links; we’re now optimizing for AI.\nThe shift is called Answer Engine Optimization, or AEO. Some practitioners also refer to it as AI engine optimization, and both terms are used interchangeably. But what does it mean to optimize your content for AI engines? I'll explain.\nAEO is the practice of optimizing your content so that AI systems cite you as a source and feature your information in direct answers. AEO helps content show up in ChatGPT responses, Google's AI Overviews, voice assistant answers , and essentially anywhere an AI is serving information instead of just links.\nBut AEO isn't here to replace your SEO program. In fact, think of them as business partners.\nTraditional SEO focuses on achieving high rankings in search engine results. AEO focuses on being the answer that AI systems pull from and cite. The goal shifts from “get people to click to your site” to “become the authoritative source AI systems trust and reference.”\nSo, where does AEO actually appear? Pretty much anywhere AI is answering questions:\nYou‘ll find that a lot of what makes good SEO also makes good AEO, such as clear, well-structured content that answers real questions. The difference is that to use AEO, you’ll also have to think about how AI systems consume, understand, and cite information, meaning some new considerations come into play.\nIf AEO isn't replacing SEO , what does it actually add to your workflow? Let me break down the practical differences.\nWith traditional SEO, you optimize for keywords. With AEO, you're also optimizing for entities , such as the people, places, things, and concepts that AI systems need to understand.\nThis means being crystal clear about who you are, what you do, and how you connect to other entities in your space. If you're a SaaS company, AI needs to know you exist and how you relate to your industry, competitors, and the problems you solve.\nThe clearer you are, the more confidently AI can cite you.\nAI systems prefer content that directly answers questions, as that's their primary purpose.\nThis doesn't mean every blog post needs to be an FAQ (please, no), but it does mean structuring content around the questions your audience is actually asking. You want fewer posts like “10 Tips for Better Email Marketing” and more posts like “How Do I Improve My Email Open Rates?” with a clear, concise answer up front.\nSchema helps AI systems understand the structure and meaning of your content. Things like FAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema provide AI with clear signals about the information you‘re providing and how it’s organized.\nWith SEO, you‘re thinking about search volume and keyword difficulty. With AEO, you’re also considering model coverage. You may wonder if you are appearing when someone asks ChatGPT or Claude about your topic. Are you cited in AI Overviews?\nAEO requires a slightly different content strategy where you're not just targeting high-volume keywords, but also the kinds of questions people ask conversationally to AI systems. These questions are often longer, more specific, and more natural-sounding than traditional search queries.\nAI gives users the answer directly, which means they may never visit your site.\nIs that frustrating? Sure. But it‘s also reality. The upside? When AI cites you, you’re building brand authority and trust. People start to recognize your name as a credible source, even if they didn't click through this time. Think of it as the long game.\nSo, what does this mean for your content team on a day-to-day basis? The good news is that you don‘t have to overhaul your entire operation. AEO layers onto what you’re already doing, but it does require some intentional shifts.\nBefore you dive into AEO tactics, make sure your foundational SEO structure is solid. Build out your topic clusters, establish your pillar content, and create a clear content architecture. AI systems crawl and understand content the same way search engines do. So, if your site structure is a mess, AEO won't save you.\nGet your house in order first. Then optimize for AI.\nOnce your clusters are built, map out the questions your audience asks at each stage of their journey. Not just “what keywords should we rank for,” but “what would someone type into ChatGPT about this topic?”\nThis is where you start creating content specifically designed to be cited, in the form of clear, direct answers, credible sources, and well-structured information—the stuff AI systems love to pull from.\nAfter your content and questions are in place, tackle schema markup and entity optimization. This is the technical layer that helps AI systems understand and cite your content more effectively.\nMark up your FAQs. Add How-To schema to your tutorials. Use the Article schema on your blog posts. Make it as easy as possible for AI to parse and reference your information.\nIf you‘re juggling ongoing SEO, content production, and now AEO on top of it all, here’s a simple prioritization framework:\nThink of it like building a house. You wouldn‘t install smart home tech before you’ve framed the walls. The same logic applies here. Build your foundation first, then the AI-friendly upgrades.\nAnd look, I get it. Adding AEO to your already packed content calendar can feel overwhelming. However, the reality is that if AI systems are answering questions in your space and you're not being cited, you're missing out on visibility and authority. Better to start small and layer it in than to ignore it completely.\nGenerative Engine Optimization (GEO) may sound like another term for AEO, but there are key differences.\nGEO specifically refers to optimizing for generative AI systems. Think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other large language models that generate responses based on prompts. GEO is all about getting these AI systems to cite your content when they're creating answers from scratch.\nAEO is the broader umbrella term. It covers optimization for any AI-powered system that surfaces answers, including generative AI, as well as AI Overviews in search, voice assistants, and other AI-augmented platforms.\nIn other words, GEO is a subset of AEO. All GEO is AEO, but not all AEO is GEO.\nThink of it like this: If someone asks ChatGPT for marketing advice and it cites your blog post, that‘s GEO in action. If someone asks Google a question and your content shows up in an AI Overview, that’s AEO (but not necessarily GEO, since it's search-adjacent).\nIf Alexa reads your recipe instructions out loud, that's also AEO.\nThey all share the same core goal: getting AI systems to pull from and cite your content as a trusted source.\nHonestly? For most content teams, the distinction between AEO and GEO is more academic than practical.\nYes, there are researchers publishing papers specifically on “generative engine optimization” and studying how to rank in LLM outputs. And yes, some practitioners use GEO when discussing ChatGPT or Claude specifically.\nBut here‘s the thing: the tactics that make you cite-able in one AI system generally make you cite-able in others. You’re not going to optimize differently for ChatGPT versus Google's AI Overviews versus Alexa. The underlying principles are the same.\nSo, while I‘ll use \"AEO\" as the catch-all term throughout this post, please note that when we’re discussing showing up in ChatGPT or other generative models, that's the GEO piece of the puzzle.\nHere‘s the best part: you don’t need separate strategies for AEO and GEO. The same content architecture that helps you show up in AI Overviews also helps you get cited by ChatGPT.\nWhether it‘s a generative AI model or Google’s AI Overview pulling your content, both love clearly structured question-and-answer formats.\nWhen you write a section that starts with “What is email marketing?” and follows with a direct, concise answer, you‘re making it easy for any AI system to extract and cite that information. The AI doesn’t care whether it's serving that answer in a chat interface or a search result. AI just needs the information to be clear and well-structured.\nFAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema are all structured data formats that help AI systems better understand your content.\nGoogle‘s AI uses schema to parse your content for AI Overviews. Generative models trained on web data can better understand and reference marked-up content properly. Voice assistants rely on schema to pull accurate information. It’s the same markup, serving multiple AI applications.\nYou implement it once, and it works across the board.\nWhen you clearly establish who you are, what you do, and how you connect to other entities in your space, every AI system benefits.\nGenerative models need entity clarity to confidently cite you. Search engines need it to include you in AI Overviews. Voice assistants need it to provide accurate answers. The work you do to strengthen your entity signals — clean NAP data, consistent branding, clear about pages, authoritative backlinks — pays dividends across every AI platform.\nDon‘t overthink the AEO vs. GEO distinction. Build content that’s clear, well-structured, and easy for AI to understand, and you'll show up across the entire ecosystem of AI-powered answer engines.\nOne solid content architecture. Multiple AI systems. Maximum coverage.\nOkay, so you're sold on AEO. Now comes the practical question: which AI systems should you actually be optimizing for?\nThe good news? You don't need to pick just one. The better news? A lot of the optimization work overlaps. But it does help to understand what each major answer engine tends to favor so you can prioritize your efforts.\nLet‘s break down the big players and what they’re looking for.\nWhat It Is: Those AI-generated summaries that appear at the top of Google search results, powered by Google's Gemini model.\nWhat It Favors: AI Overviews tend to pull from pages that already rank well organically, which are typically in the top 20 results. Google prioritizes authoritative, well-structured content with clear answers. If you‘re not showing up in traditional search, you’re likely not appearing in AI Overviews either.\nWhat It Is: Microsoft's AI assistant built into Bing, Edge, and Windows, powered by GPT-4.\nWhat It Favors: Copilot tends to handle navigational and transactional queries well. It pulls from Bing's search index and favors content that clearly states what a product or service does, includes pricing or comparison information, and has strong brand signals.\nWhat It Is: ChatGPT's newer search functionality that browses the web in real-time and cites sources in conversational responses.\nWhat It Favors: ChatGPT Search looks for credible, authoritative sources with clear entity signals. It tends to cite content that directly answers questions, comes from recognizable brands or domains, and includes proper attribution (citing other sources strengthens your own credibility).\nWhat It Is: An AI-powered search engine that provides synthesized answers with inline citations, kind of like a research assistant.\nWhat It Favors: Perplexity loves well-researched, comprehensive content that brings together multiple perspectives. It frequently cites academic sources, data-driven content, and articles that themselves include citations and sources. If your content looks like it was written by someone who did their homework, Perplexity is more likely to cite it.\nYou probably don‘t have the bandwidth to create completely different content strategies for each answer engine. And honestly, you don’t need to.\nThe overlap is significant. Clear, well-structured, authoritative content that answers real questions? That works everywhere. Strong entity signals? Helpful across the board. Schema markup? Universal.\nSo start with the fundamentals that benefit all engines, then layer in specific optimizations based on where your audience is actually looking for answers. If you‘re a B2B SaaS company, maybe you prioritize ChatGPT and Bing Copilot. If you’re in health and wellness, Google AI Overviews and Perplexity might be your focus.\nMeet your audience where they are, and optimize accordingly.\nAlright, enough theory. Let's talk about how to actually do this inside your content team.\nAdding AEO to your workflow takes some upfront effort, but the good news is you don't need to overhaul everything overnight. You can start small, test what works, and scale from there.\nHere‘s a step-by-step plan you can actually run with your team, from discovery to publishing to measuring what’s working.\nBefore you create new content, figure out where you currently stand with AI systems.\nStart by testing queries related to your business in different answer engines. Ask ChatGPT questions your customers would ask. Search relevant topics in Google and see if AI Overviews appear. Try the same queries in Perplexity and Bing Copilot.\nAre you being cited? Are competitors showing up instead? Are AI systems pulling from outdated or inaccurate sources?\nThis audit gives you a baseline and helps you identify quick wins, like topics where you have great content but aren‘t getting cited, or gaps where AI is answering questions and you’re nowhere to be found.\nNow that you know what AI systems are answering, it's time to map those questions back to your existing content strategy.\nLook at your topic clusters and pillar pages. For each cluster, brainstorm the questions someone might ask an AI system at different stages (awareness, consideration, decision) of their journey.\nFor example, if you have a content cluster around email marketing, your questions might include:\nThe goal here is to create a question map that aligns with your existing content architecture. Instead of starting from scratch, you're identifying which questions your current content answers (or should answer).\nThis is where the rubber meets the road. You're either creating new content designed to be cited or optimizing existing content to be more cite-able.\nWhen you're writing or updating content with AEO in mind, focus on:\nClear, Direct Answers Up Front Don't bury the lede. If someone asks “What is AEO?” your content should answer that question in the first paragraph, not three scrolls down. AI systems pull from content that gets to the point quickly.\nStructured, Scannable Formatting Use headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Break complex information into digestible chunks. AI systems extract information more easily from well-organized content.\nQuestion-as-Header Format Consider using the actual question as your H2 or H3 header, followed by a concise answer. For example:\n“How Do I Measure Email Marketing ROI?” “To measure email marketing ROI, divide your net profit by your total email marketing costs and multiply by 100...”\nThis format makes it incredibly easy for AI to identify and extract the relevant answer.\nInclude Context and Credibility Signals Don't just state facts, back them up. Include data, cite sources, and reference studies. This builds trust with AI systems and makes your content more cite-worthy.\nOnce your content is written (or rewritten), it's time to add the technical layer that helps AI understand it.\nImplement Schema Markup Add FAQ schema for question-and-answer sections. Use How-To schema for tutorials and step-by-step guides. Apply Article schema to blog posts. This structured data gives AI systems clear signals about what information you're providing.\nIf you‘re on WordPress, plugins like Yoast or Rank Math make this pretty straightforward. If you’re on HubSpot or another CMS, check if there's built-in schema support or work with your dev team to implement it.\nStrengthen Entity Signals Make sure your brand entity is crystal clear across your site:\nThink of entity signals as your credibility score with AI systems. The clearer and more consistent your signals, the more confidently AI can cite you.\nYou've created great content and added the technical polish. Now you need to make sure AI systems actually find it.\nGet It Indexed Submit your new or updated pages to Google Search Console. This speeds up the crawling and indexing process so AI Overviews can start pulling from your content sooner.\nPromote It Share your content on social media, in newsletters, and anywhere your audience hangs out. The more signals of engagement and authority your content has, the more likely AI systems are to trust and cite it.\nBuild Links Quality backlinks still matter. They signal to AI systems that your content is credible and authoritative. Reach out to industry publications, guest post on relevant sites, and look for natural link-building opportunities.\nHere‘s where things get tricky. Measuring AEO success isn’t as straightforward as tracking keyword rankings, but there are ways to gauge whether your efforts are paying off.\nManual Testing The most direct method: regularly test your target questions in different answer engines and see if you‘re being cited. Create a spreadsheet with your priority questions and check monthly (or weekly, if you’re ambitious) to track changes.\nIt‘s manual, it’s time-consuming, but it's also the most accurate way to see if AI systems are pulling from your content.\nMonitor Branded and Direct Traffic If AI systems are citing your brand without linking directly to your site (hello, zero-click reality), you might see an uptick in branded searches or direct traffic. People see your name in an AI response, remember it, and come find you later.\nTrack branded search volume in Google Search Console and watch for changes in direct traffic patterns.\nTrack Engagement Metrics Look at engagement on the content you've optimized for AEO. Are people staying longer? Reading more pages? Downloading resources? Even if AI gives them the quick answer, the users who do click through are often more engaged because they're already informed and interested.\nUse AEO-Specific Tools (If You Have a Budget) There are emerging tools explicitly designed to track AEO performance, such as citation tracking in LLMs or AI visibility scores. These tools are still in development, but if you have the budget and are serious about AEO, they're worth considering.\nAEO isn‘t a one-and-done project. It’s an ongoing optimization strategy that evolves as AI systems change and your content library grows.\nStart with a small pilot of 5-10 high-priority questions. Test the process, see what works, and learn what doesn‘t. Once you’ve validated the approach, scale it across more topics and content clusters.\nAnd remember: AI systems are constantly evolving. What works today might shift tomorrow. Stay curious, keep testing, and adapt your strategy as the landscape changes.\nBuilding an AEO plan takes time, but if you approach it systematically, you'll begin to see results.\nI won‘t lie to you, AEO measurement isn’t as clean as tracking keyword rankings or click-through rates. There's no universal “AEO dashboard” you can pull up that shows you exactly where you rank in ChatGPT.\nBut that doesn‘t mean you can’t measure success. You just need to get a little creative and look at a combination of signals that, together, tell the story of your AEO impact.\nLet me walk you through the metrics that actually matter and how to track them without losing your mind.\nWhat It Is: How often AI systems cite or reference your content when answering relevant questions.\nHow to Track It: This one requires manual work, unfortunately. Create a list of your priority questions (the ones you've optimized content for) and test them monthly across your target answer engines — Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Bing Copilot.\nDocument whether your content is cited, how it's cited (direct quote, paraphrased summary, link), and where it appears in the response (primary source, supporting source, or buried in the footnotes).\nYes, it‘s tedious. But it’s also the most direct way to measure whether your AEO efforts are working.\nWhat Good Looks Like: You're seeing an increase in citations month-over-month, especially in your priority answer engines. Bonus points if you move from “not cited at all” to “secondary source” to “primary citation” over time.\nWhat It Is: How often you're cited compared to competitors when AI systems answer questions in your space.\nHow to Track It: Take that same list of priority questions and note which sources AI systems are citing, like you, your competitors, industry publications, whoever. Calculate your share of voice by dividing the number of times you're cited by the total number of citations across all sources.\nFor example, if ChatGPT answers 10 questions about email marketing and cites you 4 times, a competitor 3 times, and other sources 3 times, your share of voice is 40%.\nWhat Good Looks Like: Your share of voice is increasing over time, and you‘re being cited as often (or more often) than key competitors. If you’re in a crowded space, even 20-30% share of voice is a win.\nWhat It Is: The number of people searching for your brand name specifically, which can indicate increased awareness from AI citations.\nHow to Track It: Use Google Search Console to monitor branded search queries. Look for upward trends that correlate with your AEO efforts, especially if you‘re being cited in AI systems that don’t always link back to your site.\nWhen someone sees your name in a ChatGPT response or Perplexity citation, they might not click through immediately. But later, when they need a solution, they remember your brand and search for you directly.\nWhat Good Looks Like: Branded search volume increases over time, particularly after you start getting consistent citations in AI responses. Watch for spikes that align with specific AEO wins (like landing a primary citation in a high-traffic AI Overview).\nWhat It Is: Visitors who come to your site by typing your URL directly or through bookmarks, often driven by brand recognition from AI citations.\nHow to Track It: Monitor direct traffic in Google Analytics (or whatever analytics platform you use). Look for sustained growth or unusual spikes that can't be explained by campaigns or other marketing efforts.\nIf AI systems are mentioning your brand but not always linking to you, direct traffic is one of the ways people find you afterward.\nWhat Good Looks Like: Direct traffic grows steadily as your AEO presence increases. You might also see a shift in the quality of direct traffic, such as users who arrive directly from brand recognition tend to be more engaged and further along in their buyer journey.\nWhat It Is: Metrics that indicate people are engaging with your brand even when they don't click through from an AI response, such as time on site, pages per session, and conversion rates from branded or direct traffic.\nHow to Track It: In your analytics platform, segment users who arrive via branded search or direct traffic and compare their engagement metrics to other traffic sources. Are they spending more time on site? Viewing more pages? Converting at higher rates?\nThese signals suggest that AI citations are pre-qualifying your audience. By the time they reach your site, they already know who you are and what you offer.\nWhat Good Looks Like: Users from branded/direct sources show higher engagement and conversion rates compared to cold traffic. This indicates that AI citations are building awareness and trust before users even visit your site.\nWhat It Is: Your increasing presence and authority on specific topics, measured by how comprehensively AI systems cite you across related questions.\nHow to Track It: Map out a topic cluster (say, “email marketing”) and track citations across all related questions within that cluster. Are you being cited for beginner questions? Advanced questions? Tactical how-tos? Strategic overviews?\nThe more comprehensively you're cited within a topic area, the stronger your topic authority.\nWhat Good Looks Like: You‘re being cited across multiple question types within your core topics, not just one or two. This signals to AI systems (and users) that you’re a comprehensive, authoritative source on the subject.\nWhat It Is: Direct clicks from answer engines that do provide links, such as Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, or Google AI Overviews.\nHow to Track It: Check your analytics referral traffic for sources like perplexity.ai, chatgpt.com, or Google's AI Overview traffic (which typically shows up as Google organic but can sometimes be identified through UTM parameters or landing page analysis).\nNot all AI systems link back, but the ones that do can drive highly qualified traffic.\nWhat Good Looks Like: You're seeing consistent (even if small) referral traffic from AI systems, and those visitors engage well with your content. As AI search adoption grows, this metric will become increasingly important.\nPlan for 3-6 months to see meaningful results from AEO efforts. AI systems need time to crawl, index, and begin citing your optimized content, and you‘re also building authority signals that don’t happen overnight.\nThat said, you might see early wins within 4-6 weeks for low-competition questions or if you're optimizing content that already ranks well organically.\nFAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema are your heavy hitters for AEO. FAQ schema is particularly effective because it directly maps questions to answers in a format AI systems love to extract.\nThe How-To schema works well for process-driven content, and the Article schema helps AI understand the structure and context of your long-form content.\nThe most reliable method is manual testing. Create a spreadsheet with your priority questions and check them monthly across Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot, logging when and how you're cited.\nFor scaled tracking, some emerging tools like BrightEdge and SEOclarity are adding AEO monitoring features, though the space is still maturing. You can also monitor indirect signals like branded search volume and direct traffic growth that indicate increased AI-driven awareness.\nNo, AEO complements SEO rather than replacing it. Many AI systems (especially Google AI Overviews) pull from content that already ranks well organically, so strong SEO fundamentals are actually a prerequisite for AEO success.\nThink of AEO as an evolution of SEO that optimizes for how AI systems consume and cite information, not a completely separate strategy.\nLead with the risk of inaction. Show leadership examples of competitors or industry leaders being cited in AI responses. At the same time, if your brand is absent, tie it to business metrics they care about, such as branded search growth and market authority.\nFrame AEO as a natural extension of existing SEO and content efforts rather than a net-new initiative, and start with a small pilot program (5-10 priority questions) to demonstrate ROI before asking for significant resources.\nMost importantly, emphasize that early movers in AEO are establishing authority that will be harder for latecomers to displace as AI adoption accelerates."

    "content": "At its core, an SEO audit is a step-by-step review of your website’s technical health, content quality, and search visibility. An SEO audit identifies technical, on-page, content, and link issues on a website. It helps SEO teams identify, prioritize, and fix the issues that block traffic, rankings, and, importantly, conversions. Businesses and SEO teams should create audits to identify opportunities that advance business goals and growth.\nA modern audit goes beyond identifying issues that further traditional blue-check rankings in Google Search. With AI search reshaping how users discover brands, marketers now need to evaluate entity signals, brand visibility in AI answers, and how well their content performs in generative engines.\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to run an SEO audit that’s helpful in today’s search landscape. I’ve included clear steps, examples, and an SEO audit checklist to help SEO professionals at any skill level drive measurable traffic growth.\nAn SEO audit is a structured review of your website. SEO specialists conduct audits at regular intervals, such as quarterly or yearly. Sometimes third-party consultants conduct site audits to bring a fresh set of eyes to the project.\nThe audit identifies the issues preventing your pages from ranking, being crawled, or converting. Then, the SEO strategist turns audit findings into a prioritized plan that directly supports traffic growth, lead generation, and pipeline.\nCrawlability, indexability, page speed, Core Web Vitals, structured data, and site architecture.\nMetadata, headings, internal linking, URL structure, and topic and keyword clusters .\nE-E-A-T signals, topical authority, freshness, duplication, thin pages, and content gaps.\nPages generating the most traffic or impressions, with opportunities to improve CTR and rankings.\nProduct, service, or conversion pages with the highest commercial impact and what’s blocking them from ranking higher.\nPages that convert well and can be scaled, replicated, or improved further.\nLayout friction, UX issues, unclear CTAs, messaging clarity, and engagement metrics.\nAuthority, toxic links, and opportunities to earn links your competitors rely on.\nHow clearly your brand is understood and categorized by search engines and AI models.\nHow your site appears in AI-generated answers using tools like HubSpot’s AEO Grader .\nConducting an SEO audit can feel overwhelming, even for experienced marketers. At a minimum, an SEO audit checklist includes crawlability, indexability, page speed, on-page SEO, content quality, technical SEO, and backlinks.\nA good SEO audit will surface hundreds of insights, and in-house teams often find themselves swimming in data without knowing where to start. Quick wins help cut through the noise. Spotting these early gives teams momentum and makes the rest of the audit far easier to interpret.\nHere are high-impact, low-effort opportunities SEO specialists should look out for as they move through the audit checklist (the step-by-step audit guide is coming next):\nNoticing a significant gap in your competitors’ backlinks compared to yours?\nWatch this video and learn how to get more high-quality links:\nAn effective SEO audit follows a straightforward process, from setting intent to translating data into strategic action.\nHere’s a simple five-step framework I use with clients to stay focused.\nImportant: Although I’m calling this an “SEO audit,” it should always include AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) to reflect how people discover brands today.\nDefining the purpose of your audit means getting crystal clear on why you’re doing it and what problem(s) you’re trying to solve. Every audit should start with business goals, not just a list of technical checks, and every SEO audit improves website traffic and conversions. Still, SEO consultants or SEO team members creating the audit should ask what the underlying issue is and focus efforts on the pages, templates, and metrics that matter most.\nNote: An audit is a good practice; sometimes its purpose is to enable SEO specialists to step back and view the site with a fresh set of eyes. But as a best practice, each scheduled audit should have a purpose or goal.\nBefore I pull any data, I clarify what the business wants to solve. If a client tells me they’ve lost traffic, conversions have dropped, or a new product isn’t ranking, I shape my audit around that problem. This gives me a clear roadmap. I know which pages matter most and which elements or metrics deserve the closest attention. That doesn’t mean I ignore everything else. My rule is simple: Anything I come across goes into the audit document. There’s no need to gatekeep findings because the person running the audit prioritizes them later.\nResearch and data gathering is the phase in which SEO specialists collect all quantitative signals that show how your site is performing. It’s the foundational layer of any SEO audit.\nPull all the data into one place, like a Google Sheet.\nPro tip: Keep this information stored safely, as it also serves as a benchmark for your next audit. All being well, the next audit should demonstrate an increase in metrics such as rankings, traffic, and AI visibility.\nAt this stage, I’m gathering everything — exports from crawlers, GSC, analytics, and backlink tools. This is what I call the “cookie-cutter SEO” phase: The tools do most of the heavy lifting, and anyone can technically do it. I move all the data into sheets, set up conditional formatting, and highlight anything unusual. I’m not trying to solve anything yet; I’m simply collecting and quietly analyzing the raw material.\nHuman analysis is where the raw data becomes insight. This is the strategic layer of the audit; the part that tools can’t do for you. A sophisticated SEO reads between the lines, connects patterns, and understands why the issues exist and how they impact traffic, rankings, conversions, and AI visibility. It’s where the audit stops being a spreadsheet exercise and starts becoming a roadmap.\nWhat’s critical: Align SEO insights with your business strategy — product priorities, revenue-driving pages, seasonal demand, campaigns, and sales goals. Refer back to the team’s notes and comments from step one.\nDuring this stage, I start forming ideas about where we could take the site. For example, if a brand has told me they’re interested in reaching a specific audience, I quietly spot opportunities to do so and record all insights in a spreadsheet.\nThen, even though I have a clear direction from the client in step one, I like to meet again in step four. By then, we can review the SEO data and determine whether priorities or goals need to change. Sometimes the data aligns fully with what the client said in phase one; if so, a quick confirmation is helpful before I dive into creating the plan.\nThis phase is where your SEO insights meet the realities of the business. At this stage, SEO specialists can work with stakeholders to ensure the recommendations make sense in the broader context of strategy, priorities, capacity, and upcoming campaigns. This step validates your assumptions, fills in knowledge gaps, and ensures the audit isn’t happening in a vacuum.\nSometimes, reviewing the site through the lens of an SEO audit uncovers new insights that need discussion. For example, identify an untapped audience segment, a high-potential content cluster, or a topic area that wasn’t mentioned in step one but could significantly benefit the business. This is the moment to bring those findings to the table and realign on what truly matters moving forward.\nImportant: When you get to this stage, you’ve likely got a pretty solid idea of where you want to take your strategy. Get stakeholder buy-in before creating it.\nThis is one of my favorite phases of the SEO audit checklist. As a consultant, in step one, I’m a passive listener to how the website performs. In this stage, I know what’s going on. I’m excited about the project and have my own insights. This meeting has more energy, and more insights are unlocked. When data supports ideas, it’s encouraging, exciting, and motivating.\nThis is the moment where your findings become a real strategy. After aligning with stakeholders, refine the audit into a clear, prioritized plan that the business can actually execute.\nIt’s not enough to list issues. The value of an audit lies in translating insights into structured actions, with owners, timelines, and expected outcomes.\nThis step turns the audit from a diagnostic into an actionable roadmap.\nA well-structured plan makes the audit usable, something the business can act on week by week, rather than a document that gets filed away.\nI want my audits to be so actionable that anyone could take the document and run with it, feeling confident to implement it. I assign owners, estimate effort, and rank recommendations by impact so the team knows exactly where to start. This is the step where the audit stops being a list of interesting insights and becomes a clear, focused execution plan that actually drives results. If I’m working with the business long term on implementation, I take the audit and manage the actions in a project management tool like Asana.\nSEO specialists should prioritize audit findings by impact, effort, and owner. Interpreting the SEO audit is where the real impact happens. Once the SEO team has collected its findings, the next step is turning them into a clear, prioritized plan that the business can act on. Here’s how to evaluate what matters most and where to start.\nHere are some ways to interpret the SEO report, in the order I’d prioritize:\nAnything preventing search engines from crawling or indexing key pages should rise to the top of the priority list. These issues, such as accidental noindex tags, broken internal links, or faulty robots.txt rules, can instantly suppress visibility.\nFixing them often delivers the fastest and most noticeable traffic lift.\nThese five categories (crawlability, indexability, accessibility, rankability, and clickability) and how they stack within the technical SEO hierarchy are best shown in this graphic, which echoes Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs but reimagined for search engine optimization.\nSome findings need immediate attention, not for SEO reasons, but for revenue or reputation reasons. Security vulnerabilities, broken checkout flows, incorrect pricing pages, or inaccessible and broken forms should be treated as non-negotiable priorities. These directly affect conversions and trust.\nSEO specialists should prioritize the content clusters and pages that support the company’s specific goals, whether that is targeting a new audience, promoting a key product, or expanding into a new region.\nAn SEO audit should always reflect the business’s direction.\nPro tip: Ask stakeholders for SMART goals, so they’re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. The graphic below shows what SMART goals look like .\nPrioritize content that does more than rank. Pages that support SEO, email nurturing, sales enablement, or product education create compounding value. One high-quality asset can close gaps across multiple touchpoints, especially when tied to a defined content cluster or campaign. HubSpot’s free AI content writer can help with this step.\nLook for actions that take less than 30 minutes and deliver measurable improvements.\nUpdating a title tag or adding a favicon can make a big difference. Sometimes, it’s all that’s needed to move the needle, and if that’s the case, just get it done.\nAdding a few internal links, compressing images, or deleting an irrelevant, outdated page can get actionable work moving and build momentum early in the process.\nPro tip: Celebrate the little wins, especially if other departments, like developers, are working on the project. A bit of positivity is motivating, and these small fiddly tasks are surprisingly impactful. The goal? Get the team motivated to complete the work.\nGroup related issues so teams can work efficiently. A “page speed sprint,” “schema sprint,” or “content refresh sprint” helps teams stay focused and reduces context switching.\nThis makes implementation smoother and helps deliver improvements faster.\nPlus, you can report on that particular sprint as soon as it’s done and show everyone the fruits of their labor.\nDeveloper resources are usually limited, so use them wisely. Prioritize fixes that affect the entire site: template-level speed issues, schema improvements, navigation changes, or structural improvements. These updates can influence hundreds or thousands of URLs at once.\nPro tip: Want to upscale your SEO skills? HubSpot Academy’s SEO Course will help teams learn the skills needed to do SEO work that drives results.\nThe right tools make your audit faster, more accurate, and far easier to prioritize. Below are the tools I use most often.\nHubSpot’s AEO Grader is one of the best tools for an SEO audit with AI insights. AI search grader assesses brand and entity visibility in AI search results. It evaluates how well your brand appears in AI search results, including generative engines, answer boxes, and conversational interfaces. This aligns directly with the AEO/GEO components highlighted throughout this article: entity clarity, authority signals, and brand visibility are now essential parts of a complete audit.\nWhat it is: HubSpot’s AEO Grader is a free tool that analyzes your site’s AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) readiness.\nWhy it matters: Traditional SEO audits don’t tell how AI systems interpret your brand. The AEO Grader does. It evaluates entity strength, content signals, structured data, and authority markers, all of which heavily influence whether your brand appears in AI-generated responses.\nBest for: HubSpot’s AEO Grader is best for marketers ready to move beyond classic rankings and understand how AI search systems perceive their site.\nHubSpot’s Website Grader is one of the simplest ways to get a quick snapshot of your site’s SEO health. Marketers can use free tools like Website Grader to start an SEO audit; it aligns perfectly with the “quick wins” section of this article. The tool surfaces issues around speed, metadata, and basic technical hygiene that can be fixed early in the audit process.\nWhat it is: HubSpot Website Grader is a free tool that evaluates your website’s SEO, performance, mobile usability, and security.\nWhy it matters: HubSpot Website Grader provides a quick, easy-to-understand entry point into your audit before you dive into deeper technical or competitive analysis. It’s beneficial for spotting fast fixes that take under 30 minutes.\nBest for: HubSpot Website Grader is best for marketers who want a simple, high-level snapshot before pulling data from heavier tools.\nSemrush is one of the most comprehensive SEO platforms on the market. I’ve used it for over 10 years. As mentioned earlier in this article, it continues to excel at keyword research, content insights, competitive tracking, and now AI/LLM-driven recommendations.\nWhat it does: A complete SEO toolkit covering keyword research, competitive analysis, backlink auditing, content insights, site audits, and AI search intelligence.\nBest for: Marketers or consultants who want deep keyword data, competitor insights, and robust reporting.\nScreaming Frog is a must-have for technical audits, especially when you’re working through issues like orphan pages, broken links, redirect chains, thin content, or missing metadata.\nWhat it does: A fast, locally installed crawler that scans your website and reveals all major technical issues.\nBest for: Technical SEOs or marketers who want precise, crawl-based insights. To use this tool, you must know how to derive insight from your data. Unlike the HubSpot tools listed here, it doesn’t provide insights.\nPricing: Free version, plus licensed version for $279/year.\nUsed together, HubSpot’s Marketing Hub and Content Hub make marketers unstoppable.\nHubSpot Content Hub combines content management with built-in SEO intelligence, making it perfect for implementing many of the opportunities uncovered in an SEO audit, especially those related to metadata, content quality, or outdated content.\nWhat it is: HubSpot’s Content Hub is a CMS with AI-powered SEO recommendations, content suggestions, and intelligent content tools that support editorial and technical improvements.\nWhy it matters: Content Hub helps optimize metadata, improve on-page signals, and manage content clusters.\nPro tip: SEO specialists and writers who use Breeze AI within Content Hub are automating content production.\nHubSpot Marketing Hub includes SEO tools that are directly connected to your website data, content strategy, and reporting, making it easier to find actions and implement the roadmap created in Step 5 of your audit.\nWhat it is: HubSpot’s Marketing Hub is a comprehensive marketing platform that includes SEO recommendations, content optimization tools, analytics, and reporting.\nHere’s a screenshot from Marketing Hub’s SEO report.\nWhy it matters: Marketing Hub connects your SEO insights to real business outcomes. Track performance, analyze SEO growth, manage content clusters, assign tasks, and measure the impact of your audit on traffic and conversions.\nPricing: Free plan; Starter - $9 per seat/month; Professional - $800/month; Enterprise - $3,600/month\nMost SEO audits take between two and eight weeks, depending on the size and complexity of the site, and the depth of coverage. For example, smaller sites can be completed in a few days, while enterprise sites with thousands of URLs, multiple templates, and complex technical structures take longer.\nThe analysis and stakeholder alignment phases often require the most time and are the most important. While a large portion of the audit involves data gathering and is fairly subjective, there are areas (such as content ideation) that require creativity. In my experience, creativity needs time to develop. Rush your audit, and risk missing out on creative ideas.\nSEO specialists shouldn’t rely on developers to run the audit, but developers are often needed to implement parts of it. SEOs can diagnose and document technical issues, but fixes such as template-level changes, Core Web Vitals improvements, structured data implementation, and JavaScript cleanup typically require development support. The audit itself identifies the work; the developer helps execute it.\nMost businesses benefit from a quarterly, biannual, or annual audit. Regular SEO audits help maintain and grow search performance over time.\nFast-moving companies, sites with frequent content updates, or businesses heavily impacted by AI search changes may benefit from more frequent checks. At a minimum, run a full audit once per year to benchmark performance and flag unexpected declines.\nYou can run a basic audit using free tools, including:\nThese tools cover core areas: crawlability, indexability, content quality, and AI search visibility.\nAn SEO audit focuses on the elements that influence rankings, visibility, and conversions — technical health, content quality, backlinks, and AI visibility.\nA website audit is broader. It may include UX design, accessibility, CRO, branding, navigation, and overall site performance.\nYou can think of an SEO audit as one part of a full website audit. Both can be combined, but the SEO audit is more specialized and directly tied to traffic growth and search performance.\nA well-executed SEO audit doesn’t just surface problems; it turns your website into a growth engine. By reviewing your technical health, content quality, authority signals, and AI search visibility, you can uncover quick wins, shape long-term strategy, and build a roadmap that directly supports traffic, conversions, and pipeline.\nRemember: Modern audits go beyond blue links; they evaluate how well your brand shows up in generative search and whether your content is truly understood as an entity. If you want a fast, accurate snapshot of where you stand, tools like HubSpot Website Grader and HubSpot AEO Grader make it easy to assess both SEO fundamentals and AI visibility in minutes.\nFrom my experience, the most impactful audits are the ones rooted in business goals and executed collaboratively. I love the point in the process when the data clearly aligns with what stakeholders feel intuitively — or reveals something completely unexpected. When an audit is done well, teams walk away feeling focused, confident, and energized because the path forward is so clear. That’s the sign of a great audit: One that doesn’t just diagnose, but inspires action and drives real results."
