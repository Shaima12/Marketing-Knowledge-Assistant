    "content": "At the start of my marketing career, I managed two small email lists and quickly discovered why email marketing delivers an average ROI of $36-40 for every dollar spent. With nearly 5 billion email users worldwide, it's no wonder this channel remains one of the most effective ways to reach your audience.\nIn this comprehensive email marketing guide, I'll walk you through everything from best practices to building your first campaign to advanced strategies that drive results. Whether you‘re launching your first email or optimizing an existing program, you’ll learn the proven tactics that make email marketing 40 times more effective at customer acquisition than social media.\nThe goal is building customer relationships, promoting products or services, increasing brand awareness, and ultimately driving sales.\nIn my experience, email marketing allows me to reach my target audience directly with personalized and relevant content. It’s also cost-effective, easy to track, and provides valuable data for analyzing campaign success.\nMarketers have been using email as a channel for almost as long as they’ve been using the internet. The first marketing email was sent in 1978, resulting in $13 million in sales.\nEmail has been one of the most highly used marketing channels ever since.\nThis is because email is a flexible yet cost-effective way to reach many people relatively quickly. I can also personalize my message to target specific audiences and generate leads.\nEmail marketing can take many different forms. These campaigns can include a single email announcing new content, an ongoing newsletter delivered regularly, or contacting customers about product updates.\nEmail isn’t as shiny as newer channels, like messaging and social. However, email is an effective way to build an audience that gets results.\n“One of my favorite parts about email marketing is its intimacy,” says Rob Litterst , head of strategy and operations for HubSpot’s Newsletter Network.\n“Access to someone’s inbox is sacred, and for a person to welcome you in, there’s already a certain level of trust that you just can’t achieve with other platforms,” he says.\nMaster the fundamentals of email marketing with a free online course.\nEmail marketing has steadily proven itself as a powerful channel for reaching and engaging your audience. It offers a mix of personal touch and cost-effectiveness that many other channels just can’t match. Let’s dive into some of the key benefits you can harness when you add email to your marketing strategy.\nEmail marketing is budget-friendly compared to traditional advertising methods like print ads or television commercials. Most email platforms offer affordable plans, and sometimes even free options, that still pack a punch in delivering your messages.\nSince you don’t have to invest heavily in expensive media placements, you are free to experiment more, refine your campaigns, and allocate resources to other creative or strategic projects.\nMoreover, email marketing has a high return on investment (ROI), making you an average of $36 for every $1 spent .\nOne of the reasons I rate email marketing so highly is because it gives you the ability to deliver personalized messages straight to your audience’s inbox. I’ve experienced firsthand how personal touches, like addressing me by my name or referencing a previous interaction we’ve had, has made me fall in love with a brand and made me look out for every email they send me.\nBy segmenting your email list based on factors like purchase history or interests, you can make each email feel like it was written just for that person. It’s like having a one-on-one conversation with your customers.\nEvery time you send an email, you get a chance to reinforce your brand’s identity. With consistent messaging, carefully chosen images, and a unique tone of voice, your emails help establish who you are and what you stand for. Over time, this builds a strong association between your brand and the quality or value you provide.\nYour subscribers start to recognize your style and look forward to your emails, which is exactly the kind of lasting impression you want to create. Whether it’s through eye-catching designs or thoughtful content, each email adds another brushstroke to the overall picture of your brand.\nWith email marketing, every send and every click is trackable. This level of measurement is a game-changer because you always know what’s working and what isn’t. You can look at open rates, click-through rates, bounce rates, and even conversion rates to see where you might improve.\nFor example, if a particular subject line isn’t performing well, you can adjust it and test a new approach the next time. This constant feedback loop means you’re always learning and evolving, so your campaigns get better with each send.\nConsistency is key when it comes to building lasting relationships with your customers. With email marketing, you get the chance to stay in regular contact with your audience by sharing news, special offers, or insightful content. This regular engagement isn’t just about selling — it’s about building a community around your brand.\nWhen I still ran my beauty blog, I liked to think of my (very small) email list as a group of friends who trusted my advice and recommendations. Over time, that trust translates into customer loyalty, and loyal customers are more likely to stick with your brand for the long haul.\nEvery email is a chance to drive your audience toward a goal, whether that’s making a purchase, signing up for an event, or simply visiting your website. By including clear calls-to-action (CTAs) in your emails, you guide your readers step-by-step through the customer journey.\n“While it’s the second-most used marketing channel (beat by social media), a whopping 95% of email marketers call it practical,” says Pamela Bump , head of content growth at HubSpot.\n“For HubSpot — and our blog team — we’ve deeply leveraged email and even catered blog posts to our very subscribers,” she says. “Over the years, this has driven high ROI, millions of page views, countless conversions, and even customers.”\nA great way to increase conversions is to experiment with different CTA placements and phrasing to see what resonates best with your audience. For example, you can shift your CTA button closer to the top of the email to see if it’ll result in more click-through rates. It may sound simple, but these tweaks can make a big difference in turning interest into action.\nAs your business grows, so does the challenge of staying in touch with every customer. Email sequence software comes with powerful automation tools that let you schedule emails or even trigger messages based on user actions — like a thank-you email when someone makes a purchase.\nThis means you can “set it and forget it” to a large extent. For example, when I ran the email marketing for a literary website, I set up an automated email series that nurtured leads over days or even weeks. This saved me countless hours while still delivering a personalized experience to every subscriber.\nAutomation not only helps you scale your efforts but also ensures that each customer journey is smooth and consistent.\nEmail marketing isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Depending on your audience, goals, and the current stage of your customer journey, you can adopt various email types to engage your audience effectively. Here are some common types of email marketing that you can send to your customers (with examples from my own inbox):\nYour welcome email sets the tone for your entire relationship. It typically sees the highest engagement rates of any email type — often 50% higher than standard campaigns.\nHere's a welcome email from Strava, the running app:\nWhat works: The cheerful headline creates an immediate connection. Multiple CTAs show different ways to get value, while the testimonial provides social proof. This helps new users understand exactly what they can achieve with the app.\nPromotional emails drive immediate action through special offers, discounts, or limited-time deals. They're your direct sales tool.\nWhat works: ASOS combines a compelling 70% discount with personalized product recommendations based on browsing history. The deadline creates urgency while multiple product images provide options.\nNewsletters nurture long-term relationships by delivering consistent value. They keep your brand top-of-mind between purchases while establishing your expertise.\nWhat works: Omniscient Digital's newsletter delivers deep, actionable insights without fluff. Each edition teaches something valuable, building loyalty through expertise.\nTriggered by user actions, transactional emails have the highest open rates (often 80%+) because recipients expect them. Use this engagement opportunity wisely.\nWhat works: Amazon provides all essential information while adding product recommendations to increase order value — turning a service email into a sales opportunity.\nWin back inactive subscribers before they're lost forever. These emails acknowledge the relationship gap and offer reasons to return.\nWhat works: Duolingo's emotional approach humanizes their brand mascot, creating guilt-free motivation to return. The simple CTA makes re-engagement effortless.\nRecover lost sales by reminding customers about items left behind. These emails generate 29% of all email marketing revenue despite being sent to a small segment.\nWhat works: FashionNova's 50% discount creates irresistible urgency. Buy-now-pay-later options remove financial barriers while product recommendations increase average order value.\nLead nurturing emails contain valuable information that is relevant to consumers at different stages of their buyer's journey.\nWhat works: Warby Parker's lead-nurturing email effectively addresses the issue of excessive screen time and the problems it causes for its target audience. Wrby Parker points recipients to a solution offered by the eyewear brand, which includes anti–fatigue glasses and blue-light-filtering lenses.\nDedicated emails are designed to notify recipients of specific products, offers, or services. Dedicated emails often include calls to action, urgent language, and images of products and services up for grabs.\nWhat works: The email is clever and well-formatted to fit the season, with “No Tricks, All Treats” being a fitting theme for Halloween. This dedicated email example also includes the most important information in the subject line (“Free Car Air Freshener”).\nBuilding a successful email marketing program requires strategic planning. These nine steps will guide you from initial setup through ongoing optimization, ensuring every campaign drives measurable results.\nBefore writing a single email, understand who you're talking to. Effective campaigns start with detailed buyer personas that capture:\nUse HubSpot's Marketing Analytics software to gather behavioral data that informs your personas.\nYour email marketing goals should align with broader business objectives. Start by researching industry benchmarks .\nYour email service provider (ESP) is the foundation of your program. Essential features to consider:\nQuality beats quantity every time. Focus on attracting engaged subscribers who want to hear from you.\nNever buy email lists — they damage deliverability and violate regulations.\nYour emails compete with dozens of others for attention. Stand out with:\nConsistency builds trust. Develop a sending schedule your audience can rely on:\nInform subscribers about your schedule upfront to set expectations.\nEvery audience is unique. Use A/B testing to discover what resonates:\nMadison Zoey Vettorino, former HubSpot marketing manager, emphasizes: “A/B testing is an excellent way to determine if changes will be successful before implementing on a larger scale.”\nUse insights to continuously refine your strategy. What worked last quarter might need adjustment as your audience evolves.\nPro tip: Campaign Assistant , HubSpot's AI tool, can help you quickly write effective email copy aligned with your campaign goals.\nNow, to my favorite part: filling the email list with eager prospects who are excited to hear from you.\nThere are many creative ways to build your email list (and, no, purchasing emails ain’t one).\nTactically speaking, list building comes down to two key elements that work cohesively to grow your subscriber numbers: lead magnets and opt-in forms .\nFeatured Resource: The Ultimate Guide to Email Newsletters\nYour lead magnet is exactly as it sounds: It attracts prospects to your email list, usually as a free offer.\nThe offer can take many formats, should be valuable to your prospects, and is given away for free in exchange for an email address.\nThere’s just one problem: People have become hyper-protective of their personal information. You can’t expect to receive an email address without exchanging it for something valuable.\nThink about a lead magnet that is relevant, useful, and makes your prospects’ lives easier.\nHere are a few types of lead magnets you could create:\nIf you’re short on resources, you can even repurpose existing content to create lead magnets .\nYour opt-in form is how you get a prospect’s information to add them to your list. It’s the gate between your future leads and the incredible asset you created with them in mind.\nHere are some tips for creating an enticing opt-in form:\nYour form should be branded, stand out from the page, and entice people to sign up. You want to excite readers with the offer.\nWhile your goal is to get people to enter their information, it isn’t to deceive them. Any information on your form should be a truthful representation of the offer.\nThis could be one of your first interactions with your prospect. Don’t scare them away with several long-form fields.\nAsk for only the most essential information: first name and email is a good place to start.\nIt may seem counterproductive to ask your subscribers to opt into your emails twice, but some research on open rates suggests that customers may prefer a confirmed opt-in (COI) email more than a welcome email.\nTake yourself through the user experience before you go live. Double-check that the form works as intended, the thank you page is live, and your offer is delivered as promised.\nThis is one of your first impressions of your new lead — make it a professional and positive one.\nIf all goes well, you’ll have built a robust list of subscribers and leads waiting to hear from you. But you can’t start emailing just yet unless you want to end up in a spam folder, or worse, a blocked list.\nHere are a few important things to remember before you start emailing your list.\nOnce you’ve added people to your list, you must break them down into different segments.\nThat way, instead of having a monolithic email list of everybody, you’ll have easier-to-manage subcategories that pertain to your subscribers’ unique characteristics, interests, and preferences.\nYour subscribers are humans, after all, and you should do your best to treat them as such. That means not sending generic email blasts.\nEach person who signs up to receive your emails is at a different level of readiness to convert into a customer (which is the ultimate goal of all this).\nIf you send a discount coupon for your product to subscribers that don’t even know how to diagnose their problem, you’ll probably lose them. That’s because you’re skipping the part where you build trust and develop the relationship.\nI try to make every email I send treat my subscribers like humans I want to connect with, as opposed to a herd of leads I’m trying to corral into a one-size-fits-all box.\nI’ve found the more I segment my list, the more trust I build with my leads, and the easier it is to convert them later.\nThe first step in segmentation is creating separate lead magnets and opt-in forms for each part of the buyer’s journey. That way, your contacts are automatically divided into separate lists.\nBeyond that, email marketing platforms allow you to segment your email list by contact data and behavior to help you send the right emails to the right people.\nIn reality, you can segment your list any way that you want. Just make sure to be as exclusive as possible when sending emails to each subgroup.\nNot all email lists are created equal. Some audiences prefer personalization, and others will think it’s spammy. Some audiences will like bright, eye-catching CTA buttons. Others will prefer a more subtle call-to-action.\nYou’ll never know what type of people make up your email list until you test the variables. That’s where A/B testing comes in handy.\n“If you’re considering making any structural or content alterations to your email marketing, A/B testing is an excellent way to determine if the changes will be successful or worthwhile before they’re implemented on a larger scale,” says Madison Zoey Vettorino , former marketing manager and SEO content writer for HubSpot’s Website Blog.\nA/B testing, or split testing, is a way to see what type of email performs best with your audience by analyzing the results of email A against email B. This can be especially helpful when working with templates.\n“Since emails often have the same template, A/B testing is smart because you can usually control variables outside of the test and get a solid signal on what performs better,” HubSpot’s Litterst says.\nHere’s the step-by-step process I use for A/B testing my emails:\nMost email service providers will have A/B testing built into their software, which will make it easy for you to compare email results without much manual work.\nWhen conducting an A/B test, I suggest following these tips:\n“For example, try the same email with a different subject line. Or the same email and same subject line with a different CTA,” Curtis del Principe , a content strategist and writer at HubSpot, told me.\n“It might be tempting to make several changes at once, but that makes it harder to pinpoint the true cause of your wins or losses,” he says.\nA/B test should be run with intention. Making quick changes and approaching results unscientifically can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n“You might be tempted to run an informal A/B test by making a change and then casually paying attention to the responses that you get. This unscientific method can easily be skewed by factors outside your control (like seasonality or deliverability),” says del Principe.\n“It also leaves out a ton of valuable data, like open rate, click-through rate, unsubscribe rate, or sharing/forwarding rate.”\nInstead, I recommend using an email marketing tool, like Marketing Hub or BuzzStream, to help you get a broader and more accurate understanding of your email performance.\nOnce you’ve got your first few campaigns, it’s time to see how they’re performing.\nBy diving into your email marketing analytics , you’ll be able to make better decisions that will help your business’s bottom line, resonate with your subscribers, readers, and customers, and justify your work to the rest of your company.\nI think there are four key metrics to pay attention to when evaluating the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign.\nMany factors impact your KPIs, and it will take some experimentation and guesswork to figure out which tweaks to your emails will yield the biggest significance.\nIf you aren’t getting the desired numbers, I suggest playing with these variables to improve your email results .\nOnce you’ve got some campaigns under your belt, it’s time to look at how they performed. Your data does no good if you can’t report it in an organized fashion.\nAn email marketing report is a spreadsheet where you can record your results in one place to help you make inferences from your KPIs and take action to improve them.\nKnowing the stats can help you understand the lay of the land. Here I’ve gathered some statistics regarding email marketing in general and by industry.\nEmail marketing rules change based on your industry and who you’re marketing to. Below are some email marketing trends for B2B, B2C, and ecommerce companies that can inform your email marketing strategy.\nEmail marketing compliance isn‘t optional — it’s essential for protecting your business and maintaining subscriber trust. Violations can result in hefty fines and permanent damage to your sender reputation.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act sets requirements for commercial emails in the US. Violations can cost up to $51,744 per email.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation applies to any business processing EU residents' data, regardless of location. Fines can reach €20 million or 4% of global revenue.\nCanada's Anti-Spam Legislation is one of the strictest globally, with fines up to $10 million per violation.\nCompliance isn‘t just about avoiding fines — it’s about respecting your subscribers. When you follow regulations:\nRemember: The easiest way to stay compliant is choosing an ESP that handles technical requirements automatically. Platforms like HubSpot build compliance features into their core functionality, reducing your risk.\nWhile I usually don’t think twice about the formatting or subject line of an email I send to a friend, email marketing requires a lot more consideration.\nI’ve learned that everything from the time you send your email to the devices on which your email could be opened matters.\nYour goal with every email is to generate more leads , which makes crafting a marketing email a more involved process than other emails you’ve written.\nLet’s touch on the components of a successful marketing email.\nCopy: The copy in the body of your email should be consistent with your voice and stick to only one topic.\nImages: Choose images that are optimized for all devices, eye-catching, and relevant.\nCTA: Your call-to-action should lead to a relevant offer and stand out from the rest of the email.\nTiming: Based on Mailmodo’s State of Email 2024 findings, the best day to send your emails is Tuesday. According to GetResponse’s email benchmarks report , the best time to send emails is either before your audience wakes up (4–6 am) or later in the afternoon (5–7 pm).\nResponsiveness : Nearly 50% of email marketers say 40%–60% of their email engagement comes from mobile devices. Your email should, therefore, be optimized for this, as well as all other devices.\nPersonalization: Write every email like you’re sending it to a friend. Be personable and address your reader in a familiar tone.\nSubject Line: Use clear, actionable, enticing language that is personalized and aligned with the body of the email.\nFeatured Resource: 100 Email Subject Lines We Actually Clicked\nPro tip: Leverage AI for email marketing. By using tools like our AI Email Writer , you can generate copy that suits your goals, saving time along the way.\n“Personalization isn’t just about adding a contact’s name to the subject line anymore but is all about creating personalized experiences that demonstrate you understand them and have insider knowledge about how they can use your products to succeed,” Aleia Walker , growth marketing manager at HubSpot.\nOnce you know who you’re emailing and what’s important to them, sending emails with personalized touches will be much easier.\nSure, you’re speaking to 100+ people at one time, but your leads don’t need to know it.\nPersonalized emails have higher open rates. In addition, 83% of customers are willing to share their data to create a more personalized experience.\nYou’ve gathered all this unique data. Your email marketing software allows for personalization tokens . You have no excuse for sending generic emails that don’t make your leads feel special.\n“It’s more impactful to base email personalization on two or three factors instead of just what a contact is engaging with on your side,” Walker says.\nWalker suggests, “Consider personalizing emails based on what you know about your contact, such as their location, industry, employee size, etc., alongside how they engage with your content.”\nHere are a few ways I like to personalize my emails:\nEmail marketing templates — like these ones from HubSpot — are another great resource to help you with your email marketing.\nUnless you’re a designer and developer, on top of being a skilled marketer, templates will save you a ton of time — they take the design, coding, and UX-definition work out of crafting your emails.\nJust one caveat: When making your selection, I advise choosing email templates that are proven to be effective .\nThe highest-quality templates come from the most reputable ESPs that have tested them against thousands of alternatives. So, stick with the professionals.\nIf you’re struggling with the above tips, HubSpot offers email marketing tools to help personalize your marketing emails, optimize your emails with A/B testing, and create aesthetically pleasing emails using templates.\nFurthermore, HubSpot’s Campaign Assistant uses AI technology to generate copy for marketing emails.\nEmail marketing is highly cost-effective, with many platforms offering free plans for small lists and paid plans typically ranging from $10-$300+ per month depending on list size and features. The investment is minimal compared to traditional advertising, and with an average ROI of $36 for every $1 spent, it's one of the most profitable marketing channels available.\nHubSpot offers a free email marketing service with user-friendly tools and no design or IT experience required, making it ideal for beginners. Moosend is another excellent choice for solopreneurs due to its affordability and ease of use while still covering all the basics. Both platforms provide templates, automation, and analytics to help you get started quickly.\nMost marketers send 1-4 emails per month to each subscriber, with Tuesday being the optimal day and either early morning (4-6 am) or late afternoon (5-7 pm) being the best times. The key is to establish a consistent schedule and communicate it upfront so subscribers know what to expect. Always prioritize providing value over frequency to maintain engagement and avoid high unsubscribe rates.\nA good email open rate varies by industry, but 67.1% of marketers report average open rates above 20%, which serves as a general benchmark. Open rates are influenced by factors like subject line quality, sender reputation, list segmentation, and send timing. Focus on improving your metrics over time through A/B testing rather than comparing yourself directly to industry averages.\nYes, you must obtain explicit permission before sending marketing emails to comply with CAN-SPAM and GDPR regulations. Use opt-in forms where subscribers actively choose to receive your emails, and consider implementing double opt-in for additional confirmation. Never purchase email lists, as this violates regulations and damages your sender reputation.\nAvoid spam by using a reputable email service provider, implementing double opt-in, and avoiding spam trigger words like “click below” or excessive caps and exclamation points. Ask subscribers to whitelist your email address by adding it to their contacts, regularly clean your list of inactive users, and maintain consistent sending practices. Monitor your deliverability metrics and sender reputation to catch issues early.\nNewsletters are a specific type of email marketing focused on delivering valuable content, industry news, and updates on a regular schedule to nurture long-term relationships. Email marketing is a broader practice that encompasses newsletters, promotional emails, transactional emails, welcome sequences, abandoned cart reminders, and other campaign types. Newsletters were the most sent email campaign type in 2023, followed closely by promotional emails.\nMarketing emails should be concise and focused on a single topic, with length depending on the email type and purpose. Promotional emails and CTAs are most effective when brief and scannable, while newsletters can be longer if they offer substantial value. The key is to respect your subscribers' time—keep copy clear and actionable, use short paragraphs, and ensure every sentence serves a purpose.\nEmail marketing is a powerful, cost-effective way to connect with your audience and drive business growth. With over 4.3 billion users worldwide and an average ROI of $36–$40 for every $1 spent, it remains one of the most effective digital marketing channels.\nTo succeed, start by defining your goals, building a quality email list, choosing the right platform, and sending targeted, valuable content. Track your results, follow legal requirements, and continually optimize for better performance.\nReady to launch or improve your strategy?
