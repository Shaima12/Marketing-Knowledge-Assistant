That's why HubSpot introduced loop marketing tactics, a four-stage framework designed to help you adapt and grow in the AI era.\nUnlike traditional funnels that assume buyers follow a linear path, Loop Marketing creates continuous cycles of learning and optimization that become sharper with every use.\nIn this guide, I‘ll break down exactly what loop marketing tactics are, why they outperform funnels, and how to implement them step-by-step, even if you’re still running funnel-based campaigns. Let's dive in.\nLoop Marketing is a four-stage playbook that combines artificial intelligence with human strategy to drive growth. The loop marketing playbook relies on teams of humans and AI to work together to reach and delight consumers in a world where AI answers questions before potential buyers have a chance to click on a website for answers.\nThe four stages of loop marketing are as follows, and I'll dive into them in more detail later in the post:\nWhile funnel marketing was once a tried-and-tested method, the marketing landscape has changed, and what worked even a few years ago no longer works today. Here are the facts:\nThe classic funnel represents the awareness-to-consideration-to-decision stages, assuming that buyers follow a set journey that business owners can control. However, today‘s buyers aren’t as linear in their path to purchasing; instead, they hop between channels, ask AI assistants questions, browse Reddit threads, watch YouTube reviews, and text friends for recommendations.\nYour target audience may discover you on TikTok or research you through ChatGPT before they arrive ready to make a purchase.\nTraditional funnels typically run in quarterly or semi-annual cycles. Normally, you plan a campaign, execute it, and wait for results before analyzing and adjusting months later. In the AI era, that's far too slow. Customer preferences shift rapidly, and competitors can spin up campaigns in days using AI tools.\nNow you know why the funnel model is becoming obsolete. Here's how Loop Marketing will help you win in the era of AI.\nLoop Marketing's Amplify stage explicitly addresses multi-channel reality. Instead of funneling everyone to your website, you optimize for:\nBy optimizing for multi-channel discovery, you're making your brand visible across all the places your target audience naturally searches and explores.\nThe Evolve stage is where Loop Marketing becomes truly powerful. Rather than waiting for quarterly reviews:\nThis creates a compounding advantage : every cycle makes your marketing sharper, faster, and more efficient.\nUnlike funnels, where customers “exit” after purchase, Loop Marketing makes use of every customer interaction as fuel for the next cycle:\nWe call it a “loop” because it builds momentum with each completion, rather than starting from scratch with each new campaign.\nIdentify exactly who you're targeting by learning their goals, challenges, needs, and the language they use. Use AI to efficiently analyze reviews, customer calls, comments, and community discussions to extract patterns.\nDefine your brand‘s unique value proposition, mission, tone, dos and don’ts, and non-negotiables. This becomes the instruction manual that ensures AI-generated content sounds authentically “you” rather than generic.\nDevelop creative campaign ideas informed by your style guide that clearly communicate why buyers should choose you over competitors. Claim your distinctive corner of the market.\nKey Tools: Breeze Assistant (for ICP analysis), Brand Identity (for style guide creation), Marketing Studio (for campaign asset generation)\nGather behavioral signals, intent data, firmographics, and contextual information from your CRM, call transcripts, and website behavior. Fill gaps in customer records so you understand precisely where each buyer is in their journey.\nUtilize enriched data and intent signals—such as pricing page visits or email engagement—to create targeted customer segments based on behavior, industry, role, and buying stage.\nCreate individualized content that resonates with each segment's unique needs and interests. Create landing pages, emails, ads, and CTAs that dynamically adjust based on industry, role, stage, and even time of day.\nLayer human review on AI-generated personalization to maintain accuracy and ensure content feels genuinely helpful rather than creepily automated.\nKey Tools: AI-Powered Contact Enrichment, AI Segmentation, Personalization Agent, AI-Powered Email\nPlan how your campaign will come to life across different formats (articles, videos, carousels, podcasts) and channels (owned, earned, paid).\nDiversify where you show up to reach new customers and create competitive moats. Prioritize:\nRemix every piece of content into multiple formats optimized for each channel—turn one blog post into an AEO-optimized article for ChatGPT, a vertical video for TikTok, a carousel for LinkedIn, and a podcast script.\nCombine smart ad targeting with partnerships from subject matter experts and creators your audience already trusts. Ads get you in the proper feed; creators get you in the right conversation.\nDeploy AI tools to automate production and repurposing of promotional assets at scale, turning hours of manual work into minutes.\nDesign each touchpoint with clear, contextualized CTAs and friction-free flows so every click feels like the natural next step.\nKey Tools: Marketing Studio (for multi-channel planning), Customer Agent (for 24/7 engagement), AEO Grader (for AI search optimization)\nUse AI to predict which customers and campaigns are most likely to convert, and identify potential issues or weak spots before campaigns go live.\nTrack engagement and conversion signals as they happen. Let AI highlight anomalies and patterns, so you can spend time adjusting your strategy rather than digging through data.\nLaunch quick A/B tests on headlines, offers, CTAs, audience segments, and creative elements. Test multiple variables simultaneously to learn faster.\nApply learnings from each experiment immediately to your creative, targeting, and budget allocation. Each tweak makes your next campaign sharper, faster, more economical, and harder for competitors to imitate.\nKey Tools: Marketing Analytics (for performance dashboards), ChatGPT Deep Research Connector (for pattern analysis), Email Engagement Optimization (for predictive sending)\nFortunately, you don't need to scrap your funnel to start with Loop Marketing.\nPick the stage that solves your most significant pain point—whether that‘s inconsistent messaging (Express), generic content (Tailor), declining traffic (Amplify), or slow optimization cycles (Evolve)—and layer it onto what you’re already doing.\nYour existing CRM data, email sequences, and content library plug right into the loop, and most teams see improvements within 30-60 days of implementing their first stage.\nYes, unified data is essential for personalization at scale, but “good enough” beats perfect every time. Here's what unified records matter:\nWhen customer data is scattered across your CRM, email tool, and analytics platform, you risk awkwardly welcoming long-time customers or promoting products they already own. A unified record creates one source of truth, so you actually know if, say, someone visited your pricing page twice and opened every email this month. Unified data takes the guesswork out of personalization.\nTo get started, connect your three core systems first:\nThese three give you enough data to build segments, personalize emails, and create landing pages that speak to where customers actually are in their journey. Layer in sales platforms, support tickets, and purchase history as you grow.\nDon't worry too much about perfection at the start, because the goal is to have enough unified data to stop sending the wrong message to the right person.\nAEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is a method for getting your brand mentioned when people ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude a question, rather than searching for it on Google.\nIt‘s a critical piece of the Amplify stage because nearly 60% of searches now end without a click. People get their answers directly from AI, so if you’re not optimized for these tools, you're invisible.\nTo show up in AI responses, structure your content with clear Q&A sections that directly answer common questions, use consistent language that matches how your customers actually talk, and make it easy for AI engines to pull and cite your information.\nThink of it this way: SEO got you ranked on Google, but AEO gets you recommended by AI.\nThe flywheel is a growth philosophy that illustrates how customer momentum drives business growth through the attract, engage, and delight process. Loop Marketing is the tactical operating system that makes the flywheel spin faster.\nBasically, the flywheel tells you why customer success creates more customers, while Loop Marketing tells you how to actually do it through four continuous stages (Express, Tailor, Amplify, Evolve).\nThe loop provides a practical framework for creating content, personalizing it at scale, distributing it across channels, and optimizing it in real-time. They're not competing strategies; rather, Loop Marketing is how you operationalize the flywheel in the AI era, adding speed and AI-powered efficiency to your growth engine.\nStart with whichever stage fixes your most significant pain point; there's no “correct” order here.\nIf your brand messaging feels inconsistent or AI tools like ChatGPT are misrepresenting you, start with Express to refine your voice and ideal customer profile. If your brand is solid but everything you send feels generic, and engagement is declining, consider using Tailor to build segments and personalize at scale.\nStruggling with declining traffic or not showing up where your customers actually search? Amplify will help you diversify channels and optimize for AI search engines. And if you're already seeing success but your optimization cycles take forever, Evolve lets you test, learn, and adapt in days, not quarters.\nMost teams see improvements within 30-60 days of nailing their first stage, so pick the gap that‘s costing you the most right now and start there. You can always add the other stages once you’ve got momentum, because Loop Marketing is modular by design.\nLoop marketing is a modern, AI-powered approach that replaces linear funnels with a continuous cycle of four stages: Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve. Unlike traditional funnels, loops learn and improve with every cycle, compounding results over time.\nEach stage has specific tactics: define your brand voice and ICPs, personalize with unified data, diversify and optimize distribution for AI engines, and rapidly test and adapt.\nStart by identifying your biggest bottleneck and apply the right stage tactics using tools like HubSpot’s Smart CRM and Breeze AI.
