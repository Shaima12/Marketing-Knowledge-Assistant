    "content": "Pinterest is home to a creative, buyer-ready community, making it an ideal network to include in your social media marketing strategy . Pinners save 1.5 billion posts weekly, and over 50% of these users see Pinterest as a network they can shop on.\nThat makes Pinterest a strategic place to position yourself as the go-to solution at the moment of purchase intent. Find out how to set up an account with actionable data, and how the network can help your brand connect with users to drive growth.\nPinterest ranks as the 16th largest social media network in 2025, but it’s far more than that. It’s also a visual search platform where users can find creative ideas and inspiration, and plan for purchases.\nWith its high-intent environment, Pinterest is the perfect place for a brand to build a presence and feature its products. Think of Pinterest as a digital bulletin board where inspiration meets action.\nFor example, users can search for a term like “best running shoes” and discover visual posts. They can then collect these posts by saving them in a Board. They can also purchase an item by clicking on the post’s link for more information.\nPinterest users log in with a purpose: to plan, shop and take action, not just browse. But that’s just one part of understanding its community.\nOne unique trait, for example, is that the Pinterest user base skews female and has a big influence on younger generations. Here are some key statistics about Pinterest’s users :\nIn the data below, Pinterest provides even more details:\nAs the platform continues to grow, brands on Pinterest can increase their discoverability for buyer-intent communities by investing in keyword-rich purchasing search terms.\nPinterest’s bulletin board–style setup has shaped its own culture, and with it, generated a few unique terms you’ll want to know. Here are a few of them:\nThe best way to get a feel for Pinterest’s culture is to dive in, set up an account and start engaging with other Pinners.\nGetting started with Pinterest is quick and simple. Visit Pinterest , and on the right side of the page, you’ll see the login widget.\nIf you want to open a personal account to get to know the network and audience, follow these steps:\nUnlike personal accounts, Pinterest business accounts give you access to advanced analytics and more brand visibility.\nHere are some key advantages of a business account:\nThese business features put you in charge of how your brand gets discovered, builds credibility and drives growth on Pinterest.\nCreating a business Pinterest account is similar to a regular account, but there’s a small difference. When you go to the standard sign-up page as before (see above), instead of clicking on Not on Pinterest yet? Sign up , choose Are you a business? Get started here! Then, follow these steps:\nIf you’re new to Pinterest, start by sharing your ideas. This step will help you get to know the visual search platform and engage with Pinners.\nearly by connecting a domain to your account. This will give you more insight into how users interact with your Pins and profile.\nIf you’re already a Pinner with a personal profile, don’t let that hard-earned credibility go to waste. Converting your personal account into a business account lets you keep your Boards and following while unlocking tools that amplify your reach and results.\nHere’s how to convert your personal account to a business version:\nSprout brings your Pinterest strategy to life by connecting publishing, collaboration, listening and reporting in one place, helping your team move from ideas to execution quickly.\nOnce you have a Pinterest business account, you can connect it to Sprout to manage your Pinterest marketing strategy. Here’s how:\nBy tapping into curiosity and contributing to the platform, you can connect with your target audience and grow your brand. Here’s a guide on how to become a true Pinner and engage with your target audience.\nOn your home screen, use the search bar at the top to look for content. For example, you might type in “dog treats” to find products and ideas for your pet. After searching, you’ll see dozens of Pins.\nFor more precision, filter your options by videos, Boards or products.\nYou can also select additional keywords under your search bar. For example, for dog treats, you could select “homemade,” “pumpkin” or “banana yogurt peanut butter frozen.” These segmented search terms highlight popular niches you can target.\nIf you see a post you like, Pin it. You can also click on each Pin and engage with the post by commenting on or liking it.\nSprout tip: Not sure where to start? On the left side menu bar, click the explore icon and choose a category to discover terms and ideas by topic.\nAs you collect and post dozens of Pins, your experience may begin to feel messy. Thankfully, there’s a better way to organize your Pins: Boards.\nThese groupings help you categorize Pins for your followers. Pinners enjoy Boards because they can explore their niche interests in a single, curated place.\nFor your more complex Pinterest Boards, you can create Board Sections. Here’s how:\nPins let you save your favorite ideas and build your own library of inspiration. Here’s how to create (and save) your first one.\nWhen you see a Pin you like, choose the Board you want to add it to by using the drop-down menu next to Save . Then click Save .\nWhen you add your title and description, keep keywords in mind. Pinterest is a visual search engine, so users will use popular terms to find your content. Your posts should include relevant terms to increase their discoverability.\nNow that you know your way around Pinterest, you can embed it into your search and social media strategy.\nSprout’s Social Index shows that 93% of consumers want brands to keep up with internet culture. Pinterest is where those trends take shape, making it a strategic space for social teams to stay relevant and connect with their audience.\nAnother trend to watch is how Pinterest plays a role in evolving social media habits. According to Sprout’s 2025 Content Benchmarks Report , 86% of social media users will increase or maintain how much time they spend on social media.\nUnlike many other platforms, Pinterest’s content doesn’t fade away after the first few days you post. It’s a long-term growth channel with search-driven discovery. Each Pin is an evergreen asset. Your posts remain relevant not only in search results but also in Pinners’ Boards and curated selections.\nAs users spend more time on social media, your evergreen Pins serve as potential touchpoints. When someone searches for an idea, pain point or product category, you’re likely to show up for your targeted terms with those Pins.\nPinterest also provides KPIs that you can use to measure success. Here’s how it can directly support your core business objectives:\nPinterest content creation is a growth lever. Each post should focus on quality and relevance even more than volume. To improve your success, when you’re designing your Pinterest content calendar, ask yourself what would provide the most value first. Avoid focusing on how many posts you can push out.\nNew accounts benefit from focus. To get the most out of your strategy, start with a set of Boards built around your highest-value keywords—no more than 10.\nAlso, work with your SEO team to unify the top keywords with your overall strategic goals. Focusing on Boards with search intent helps you get the most ROI out of your effort.\nPro tip: Use Pinterest Trends to find popular keywords and products on the platform.\nTo align with search intent and keywords, strategically craft all your titles and descriptions for Pinterest SEO for both Boards and Pins.\nFor example, if you sell ergonomic computer accessories like keyboards, mice and monitor arms and your target audience is remote-work employees, you should keep descriptions short, specific and relevant. Here’s an example:\nThe Board’s key focus is keyboards for remote work employees, and it highlights buyer-intent keywords like “keyboards for remote work” and keyboards with minimal “wrist strain” that improve “productivity” and feel “comfortable.” These terms often appear when users search for comfortable remote work keyboards.\nAdditionally, include relevant hashtags to improve discoverability and align your content with trending searches. Each post should also have a clear CTA to your product, website or gated content. That way, you can drive users down your marketing funnel.\nHere’s a good example from a personalized gift company:\nThe search intent, keywords and description clearly show that this Pin is for students or parents who want to give a candle to their teacher in the UK.\nIn contrast, here’s a weak example from a lifestyle brand:\nA better option would be posting something like this:\nIn this improved approach, the focus is on luxury beeswax candles for people on a budget who want to sell in their community. Keywords like “side business,” “beeswax candle,” “recipes” and “business plan” increase the chances of discoverability.\nDesign matters just as much as your copy, and that’s especially true with Pinterest. The social network offers many different styles and formats for your Pins. It’s important to use best practices both for Pinterest and social media marketing trends.\nCreate Pins for successful performance by following these best practices:\nWhile Pins are typically evergreen, the time you post on social media can also help you get that first boost of impressions and reach. The best times to post on Pinterest are daily at 1 p.m. For specific days, post on weekdays for best results and expect lower engagement on the weekends.\nIdea Pins leverage social trends like video-first content, voiceovers and step-by-step topics, like in a typical social media “story.” Mixing formats like video, voiceovers and step-by-step visuals turns your Pins into immersive experiences—perfect for tutorials, unboxings and how-to content.\nFor example, a coffee shop could post an Idea Pin on how to make a latte with a maple leaf design in the milk.\nHere’s another example by Solid Starts, a brand and app focused on infants and eating:\nProduct tagging also helps with conversion. These tags contain information like product details, pricing and availability, all within the same post. Using both Idea Pins and product tagging, you can blend narrative posts with reality and commerce tactics, like featuring a product and promoting purchases.\nUsing a social media management tool can help you build your Pinterest campaigns, measure them and tie your results to business growth. Sprout, for instance, simplifies collaboration and consistency for your brand on Pinterest. Here’s how:\nWith Sprout, publishing a Pin is simple. Click Compose and choose your Pinterest profile.

Below are some key best practices to help you measure Pinterest success.\nAs a social media professional, you have a unique opportunity to prove ROI with accurate data and insights. If you have a business account on the platform, you can track your metrics through Pinterest analytics . The dashboard provides valuable insights to track your following and pinning success.\nWhile Pinterest’s analytics feature offers a helpful foundation for social media tracking, it doesn’t give you a holistic view that ties all your platform initiatives to business goals. However, Sprout’s Premium Analytics does, with a more in-depth view of your data in the context of your entire social media strategy.\nFor example, easily analyze profiles by network, build cross-network dashboards and custom reports, and use interactive charts and graphs for detailed insights.\nWith Premium Analytics, you can tailor your reports for stakeholders, use AI Assist to inform your strategy and choose the specific metrics you want to track. The example below shows how you can filter and analyze your data:\nPinterest analytics show how your content performs, and Sprout’s Premium Analytics takes it further by tying your strategy to real business impact. Here are the key metrics to track:\nYou can access these metrics and more data within Sprout’s Pinterest Profile Report. Then, compare all your platform-specific reports with the Profile Performance, Post Performance and Tag Performance reports.\nAnalytics guide your strategy when you compare which Pins, Boards and comments resonate most with your audience.\nWhile Sprout’s Listening doesn’t use Pinterest as a source, you can discover content themes from other platforms and use them to inform your Pinterest content. This tactic saves you hours of manual tracking and research.\nPinterest insights are powerful on their own, but when you combine them with real-time data from other social networks, you get the full picture to shape your strategy. With clear reports, you can tie your social media efforts to business outcomes.\nFor example, you can use a customized dashboard and export-ready visuals to win stakeholder buy-in and attribute your content to metrics like leads, conversions and reach.\nHere’s what the Profile Performance report looks like:\nPinterest is already a powerful way to connect with your audience, and new trends are shaping where it’s headed next.

With these trends, Pinterest becomes a uniquely positioned platform to meet visual and social media search demand.\nBecause Pinners use the platform to search visually for ideas and products, social media marketers can leverage these community habits to share engaging content (like videos, infographics and images), meet search intent and drive connections.\nBuild your Pinterest strategy with video-first content in mind to meet rising video consumption trends. Idea Pins and Video Pins are great options to meet this video demand and connect with your audience.\nIdeas include product unboxings, social media influencers trying out your product and marketing campaigns that focus on showing DIY or trendy use cases for your products.\nSprout’s Social Index states that 28% of consumers make impulse purchases each month because of social media. And since 81% feel compelled to buy several times a year, in-platform shopping looks to be the trend in the coming years.\nAs a result, your brand needs to show up where consumers are, especially when they’re ready to buy. By engaging with Pinners, posting your Pins and curating Boards with keyword-rich, buyer-intent strategies, you’ll meet Pinterest shoppers where they are.\nAs Pinterest continues to meet the growing demand for visual search and community, you can meet target audience demand and engage with your community.
