YouTube channel verification gives you a badge next to your channel name, letting viewers know that they’re seeing the official version of your page. YouTube account verification also unlocks new features to increase your YouTube marketing strategy .\nGetting verified on YouTube is simple, but you’ll need to meet a few requirements before you apply. In this post, we’ll explain what YouTube verification is, the benefits of getting verified and the steps you need to take to get verified on YouTube.\nYouTube verification is the process that confirms your identity and authenticates your channel. There are two types: account verification (available to anyone via phone number) unlocks features like custom thumbnails and longer uploads, while channel verification (requires 100,000+ subscribers) grants you the verified badge. That checkmark next to your channel name signals authenticity to viewers.\nYouTube account verification and channel verification builds trust with your viewers. A verified badge shows that you’re an official channel or account, and it make viewers feel more confident that they’re seeing accurate information from a source they trust. Other benefits of YouTube verification include:\nUpload longer videos: By default, you upload videos that are 15 minutes long, but verified accounts upload videos longer than 15 minutes .\nLivestream on YouTube: To livestream , your channel needs to be verified and you need to have no live streaming restrictions in the past 90 days.\nAdd custom thumbnails to your videos: If you’re not verified, you only choose from thumbnails that YouTube automatically generates. If you’re verified, you may upload your own.\nAppeal content ID claims: Content ID claims happen when your uploaded video matches all or part of another YouTube video. When you’re verified, you dispute these claims .\nYouTube offers two distinct verification types, each serving different purposes.\nAccount verification: This type of verification is available to anyone with a YouTube account in good standing. When you verify your account, YouTube will send a verification code to your phone. Once you enter the code, your account is verified. This verifies that you’re a real person and not a bot, and it unlocks some extra YouTube features.\nChannel verification (YouTube verification badge): This type of verification is available to channels with 100,000 subscribers or more. To verify your channel, you’ll need to submit a verification form. YouTube will then review your channel and, if it meets the criteria, verify your channel. This gives your channel a verified badge, which helps build trust with your viewers.\n100,000+ subscribers (or well-known outside YouTube)\nUnlocks platform features (custom thumbnails, longer videos, livestreaming)\nTo get a YouTube verification badge for your channel, you need to meet these eligibility requirements:\nActive channel with banner, description, profile picture and regular content uploads\nAccurate identity, age, name—your channel represents who you claim to be\n100,000+ subscribers (exceptions for well-known entities outside YouTube)\nConsistent, high-quality content that follows Community Guidelines\nIt’s rare, but YouTube sometimes verifies a channel with fewer than 100,000 subscribers if it is “well-known outside of YouTube.” For example, YouTube sometimes verifies a musician’s channel that hasn’t built a large following on the platform if the artist is popular on other platforms.\nContact YouTube if you need more information about this process.\nAccount verification on YouTube is easy. Go to YouTube.com/verify and enter your phone number. YouTube will send a verification number to your phone, and once you enter it in, you’re verified!\nYouTube channel verification is a bit more complicated but still manageable. We’ve broken it down step-by-step to make sure you don’t get lost.\nStep 1. Meet all of the requirements for YouTube verification.\nStep 2. Fill out the channel verification application. If you’re already at 100,000 or more subscribers, congrats! You’re a star.\nStep 3. Fill out the channel verification application. Fill out the application with your channel name and ID. Find your YouTube channel ID by clicking the link at the bottom of the application form or by going to Settings > Advanced Settings in your YouTube account.\nStep 4. Once you’ve completed the application, click Submit. YouTube will review your application and get back to you with a decision within a few weeks. YouTube considers the age of your channel, your identity, the content you create and your audience.\nThat’s all there is to it! If everything checks out, YouTube will grant you a coveted YouTube verification badge, which displays a check mark beside your channel name across the platform.\nOnce you submit your application, YouTube reviews verification applications within two to four weeks. This timeline varies based on application volume and the complexity of reviewing your specific channel.\nKeep your channel active while you wait. Continue uploading high-quality content and engaging with your community. Don’t change your channel name, URL or handle during this period. This slows down the process or leads to rejection.\nIf you haven’t heard back after a month, check your email spam folder or log in to YouTube Studio for status updates.\nProtect your verification badge by following these rules:\nDon’t violate the Terms of Service or Community Guidelines\nViolating these guidelines can result in YouTube taking away your verification badge.\nIf you aren’t yet eligible for YouTube channel verification, here are some tips to support you in getting there:\nChoose a great channel name: This is one of the first things people will see when they come to your channel, so make it count.\nUse an eye-catching profile picture and cover photo: Make sure these are high-quality and on-brand.\nCreate top-notch video thumbnails: Thumbnails are like little ads for your videos. Make sure they’re attractive and tell viewers what to expect from your content.\nCreate interesting and shareable content: This is the most important thing you can do to grow your channel. If you make great videos, people will want to watch them, no matter what your subscriber count is.\nGet involved in the YouTube community: Comment on other people’s videos, collaborate with other creators and participate in YouTube groups and forums.\nPay attention to YouTube SEO: This supports your videos in showing up more often in search results.\nBe patient: Growing a successful YouTube channel takes time.
